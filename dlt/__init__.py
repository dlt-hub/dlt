How to create a data loading pipeline with dlt in 3 seconds:

    1. Write a pipeline script
    >>> import dlt
    >>> import requests
    >>> dlt.run(requests.get("https://api.chess.com/pub/player/magnuscarlsen/games/2022/11").json()["games"], destination="duckdb", table_name="magnus_games")

    2. Run your pipeline script
    $ python magnus_games.py

    3. See and query your data with autogenerated Streamlit app
    $ dlt pipeline dlt_magnus_games show


Or start with our pipeline template with sample chess.com data loaded to bigquery

    $ dlt init chess duckdb
