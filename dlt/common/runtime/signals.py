    This handler is installed by intercepted_signals(). On the first occurrence of a
    supported signal (eg. SIGINT, SIGTERM) it requests a graceful shutdown by
    setting a process-wide flag and waking sleeping threads via exit_event.
    A second occurrence of the same signal escalates by delegating to the
    original handler or the system default, which typically results in an
    immediate process termination (eg. KeyboardInterrupt for SIGINT).

    Args:
        sig: Signal number (for example, signal.SIGINT or signal.SIGTERM).
        frame: The current stack frame when the signal was received.

    Notes:
        - The CPython runtime delivers signal handlers in the main thread only.
          Worker threads must cooperatively observe shutdown via raise_if_signalled()
          or the signal-aware sleep().
