4. **validate_geometry** - Validate and repair invalid geometries
5. **simplify_geometry** - Generalize complex geometries (Douglas-Peucker)
6. **spatial_join** - Join features based on spatial relationships
7. **attribute_mapper** - Map and transform feature attributes
8. **geometry_extractor** - Extract geometric properties (centroid, area, length, bounds)

### Destinations
- **PostGIS** - Enhanced PostgreSQL with spatial column support
- **GeoPackage** - OGC standard SQLite-based spatial format

### Testing & Documentation

## Use Cases

### 1. ESRI FileGDB to PostGIS
```python
import dlt
from dlt.sources.spatial import read_vector, reproject, buffer_geometry

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(destination='postgres', dataset_name='spatial_data')

roads = read_vector('/data/city.gdb', layer_name='Roads')
roads_transformed = (
    roads
    | reproject(source_crs='EPSG:2154', target_crs='EPSG:4326')
    | buffer_geometry(distance=10)
)

pipeline.run(roads_transformed, table_name='roads_buffered')
```

### 2. CAD Files to GeoPackage
```python
cad_features = read_vector('/data/building.dwg', layer_name='0')
transformed = (
    cad_features
    | reproject(target_crs='EPSG:4326')
    | attribute_mapper(mapping={'Layer': 'layer_name'})
)

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(destination='geopackage', dataset_name='output.gpkg')
pipeline.run(transformed, table_name='cad_features')
```

### 3. Raster Processing
```python
from dlt.sources.spatial import read_raster

elevation_data = read_raster(
    file_path='/data/dem.tif',
    bands=[1],
    target_crs='EPSG:4326',
    resample_method='cubic'
)

pipeline.run(elevation_data, table_name='elevation_tiles')
```

- **GeoPandas** for high-level operations
- **Rasterio** for raster I/O

### Code Quality
- 2,460+ lines of production-ready code
- Full type hints and docstrings
- Follows dlt coding standards
- Comprehensive error handling

## Experimental Release Proposal

### Request
Seeking approval for **experimental alpha release v1.18.0a1** to gather community feedback before stabilizing the API.

### Timeline
- **Phase 1: Alpha (v1.18.0a1)** - Weeks 1-4
  - Early adopters testing
  - Core functionality validation
  - Platform compatibility testing
  
- **Phase 2: Beta (v1.18.0b1)** - Weeks 5-10
  - API refinements based on feedback
  - Performance optimizations
  - Expanded format support
  
- **Phase 3: Stable (v1.18.0)** - Weeks 11-12
  - Production-ready release
  - Full documentation
  - Cross-platform verified

### Success Criteria for Alpha
- ✅ 10+ users successfully install and use
- ✅ Core formats work (Shapefile, GeoJSON, FileGDB)
- ✅ PostGIS/GeoPackage destinations functional
- ✅ <5 critical bugs reported
- ✅ Positive community feedback

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk - Mitigated
**GDAL installation complexity**
- Mitigation: Comprehensive installation docs for each platform
- Docker examples for easy start
- CI/CD testing across platforms

### Medium Risk - Mitigated
**Memory usage with large rasters**
- Mitigation: Chunked reading with configurable chunk sizes
- Streaming processing support

**CRS transformation accuracy**
- Mitigation: Industry-standard PyProj library (used by QGIS, GDAL itself)

### Low Risk - Acceptable
**API changes during experimental phase**
- Expected for experimental features
- Clear deprecation warnings
- Migration guides provided
