If the condition evaluates to `NULL` or `true`, it returns the input argument, if the condition evaluates to `false`, it throws an invalid input exception.\r\n\r\nThe `input` argument can be any type. The `condition` argument should evaluate to a boolean.\r\n \r\n\r\nExample for a failed assertion:\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 5 AS denom\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT 0 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\nInvalid Input Error: Assertion failed for assert(denom, (denom != 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for a verified assertion\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT denom.assert(denom != 0) as denom\r\n  // OR assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 1 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n----\r\n42\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Please let me know if I missed any details, to be able to support the any type, I could not use the existing utility functions.",

If the condition evaluates to `NULL` or `true`, it returns the input argument, if the condition evaluates to `false`, it throws an invalid input exception.\r\n\r\nThe `input` argument can be any type. The `condition` argument should evaluate to a boolean.\r\n \r\n\r\nExample for a failed assertion:\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 5 AS denom\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT 0 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\nInvalid Input Error: Assertion failed for assert(denom, (denom != 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for a verified assertion\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT denom.assert(denom != 0) as denom\r\n  // OR assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 1 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n----\r\n42\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Please let me know if I missed any details, to be able to support the any type, I could not use the existing utility functions.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

If the condition evaluates to `NULL` or `true`, it returns the input argument, if the condition evaluates to `false`, it throws an invalid input exception.\r\n\r\nThe `input` argument can be any type. The `condition` argument should evaluate to a boolean.\r\n \r\n\r\nExample for a failed assertion:\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 5 AS denom\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT 0 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\nInvalid Input Error: Assertion failed for assert(denom, (denom != 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for a verified assertion\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT denom.assert(denom != 0) as denom\r\n  // OR assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 1 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n----\r\n42\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Please let me know if I missed any details, to be able to support the any type, I could not use the existing utility functions.",

If the condition evaluates to `NULL` or `true`, it returns the input argument, if the condition evaluates to `false`, it throws an invalid input exception.\r\n\r\nThe `input` argument can be any type. The `condition` argument should evaluate to a boolean.\r\n \r\n\r\nExample for a failed assertion:\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 5 AS denom\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT 0 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\nInvalid Input Error: Assertion failed for assert(denom, (denom != 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for a verified assertion\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT denom.assert(denom != 0) as denom\r\n  // OR assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 1 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n----\r\n42\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Please let me know if I missed any details, to be able to support the any type, I could not use the existing utility functions.",

          "body": "> Thanks for the PR! So the core idea here is that multiple ordered aggregates are finalized/ordered at once, correct?\r\n> \r\n> Is there a possibility that this will degrade performance in case the inputs are larger? For example, if we have 1000 rows per aggregate, we would now be sorting 2 million rows at once, instead of 1000 rows 2048 times. I imagine there is some threshold where this batching no longer has a positive impact.\r\n> \r\n> Perhaps you could run some benchmarks, and adaptively figure out whether or not to combine states before sorting?\r\n\r\nYes that's a good point. Basically a mix of the two. Pull out the sizes without sinking into the `LocalSortState` and then switch based on some threshold.  The state should be tracking the size anyway for the eventual linked list integration.",

Basically deserialises the given json back into a sql string which is then executed normally.\r\n\r\nI have tested this by hacking in a json ser/de roundtrip in the DeserializedStatementVerifier, and it passes the entire duckdb unit test suite, so I am reasonably confident that this implementation is correct and serializes e.g. all the types, expressions and values correctly, but I will add a proper deserialization/serialization verification pass when I add the binary FormatDe/Serializer in core duckdb.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "This is a continuation of #6647 and  adds three new functions:\r\n- `json_deserialize_sql(JSON)`: convert a json serialized sql select statement back into an (equivalent) sql statement string.\r\n- `json_execute_serialized_sql(JSON)`: execute a json serialized sql select statement directly as a table function - basically as if it were a subquery.\r\n- `PRAGMA json_execute_serialized_sql(VARCHAR)`: execute a json serialized sql select statement as if it were a top level statement through a pragma instead. Basically deserialises the given json back into a sql string which is then executed normally.\r\n\r\nI have tested this by hacking in a json ser/de roundtrip in the DeserializedStatementVerifier, and it passes the entire duckdb unit test suite, so I am reasonably confident that this implementation is correct and serializes e.g. all the types, expressions and values correctly, but I will add a proper deserialization/serialization verification pass when I add the binary FormatDe/Serializer in core duckdb.\r\n\r\n",

The first phase is moving away from `std::vector` to our class (which is derived from std::vector), and the next phase will be to introduce the safety check.\r\n\r\nThe safety check will likely incur some performance issues where vectors are being indexed heavily, and will require some profiling to figure out where this happens.\r\nThat's the main reason for doing this in two phases",

The first phase is moving away from `std::vector` to our class (which is derived from std::vector), and the next phase will be to introduce the safety check.\r\n\r\nThe safety check will likely incur some performance issues where vectors are being indexed heavily, and will require some profiling to figure out where this happens.\r\nThat's the main reason for doing this in two phases",

Basically deserialises the given json back into a sql string which is then executed normally.\r\n\r\nI have tested this by hacking in a json ser/de roundtrip in the DeserializedStatementVerifier, and it passes the entire duckdb unit test suite, so I am reasonably confident that this implementation is correct and serializes e.g. all the types, expressions and values correctly, but I will add a proper deserialization/serialization verification pass when I add the binary FormatDe/Serializer in core duckdb.\r\n\r\n",

So the core idea here is that multiple ordered aggregates are finalized/ordered at once, correct?\r\n\r\nIs there a possibility that this will degrade performance in case the inputs are larger? For example, if we have 1000 rows per aggregate, we would now be sorting 2 million rows at once, instead of 1000 rows 2048 times. I imagine there is some threshold where this batching no longer has a positive impact.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could run some benchmarks, and adaptively figure out whether or not to combine states before sorting?",

So the core idea here is that multiple ordered aggregates are finalized/ordered at once, correct?\r\n\r\nIs there a possibility that this will degrade performance in case the inputs are larger? For example, if we have 1000 rows per aggregate, we would now be sorting 2 million rows at once, instead of 1000 rows 2048 times. I imagine there is some threshold where this batching no longer makes sense.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could run some benchmarks, and adaptively figure out whether or not to combine states before sorting?",

So the core idea here is that multiple ordered aggregates are finalized/ordered at once, correct?\r\n\r\nIs there a possibility that this will degrade performance in case the inputs are larger? For example, if we have 1000 rows per aggregate, we would now be sorting 2 million rows at once, instead of 1000 rows 2048 times. I imagine there is some threshold where this batching no longer makes sense.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could run some benchmarks, and adaptively figure out whether or not to combine states before sorting?",

If the condition evaluates to `NULL` or `true`, it returns the input argument, if the condition evaluates to `false`, it throws an invalid input exception.\r\n\r\nThe `input` argument can be any type. The `condition` argument should evaluate to a boolean.\r\n \r\n\r\nExample for a failed assertion:\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 5 AS denom\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT 0 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\nInvalid Input Error: Assertion failed for assert(denom, (denom != 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for a verified assertion\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT denom.assert(denom != 0) as denom\r\n  // OR assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 1 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n----\r\n42\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Please let me know if I missed any details, to be able to support the any type, I could not use the existing utility functions.",

After reading the discussion on #6775 I prefer the `ERROR` option for three reasons, (1) the ability for the user to specify an error message, (2) compatibility with BigQuery, (3) simplicity and clarity in what the function accomplishes. It is rather unusual for `assert` to return its input value, and it took me a while to parse what was actually happening here. I think the `ERROR` function is a cleaner solution that would be more understandable to users.\r\n\r\nApologies for not realizing the discussion happening there earlier. \r\n",

If the condition evaluates to `NULL` or `true`, it returns the input argument, if the condition evaluates to `false`, it throws an invalid input exception.\r\n\r\nThe `input` argument can be any type. The `condition` argument should evaluate to a boolean.\r\n \r\n\r\nExample for a failed assertion:\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 5 AS denom\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT 0 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\nInvalid Input Error: Assertion failed for assert(denom, (denom != 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for a verified assertion\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT denom.assert(denom != 0) as denom\r\n  // OR assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 1 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n----\r\n42\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Please let me know if I missed any details, to be able to support the any type, I could not use the existing utility functions.",

After reading the discussion on #6775 I prefer the `ERROR` option for three reasons, (1) the ability for the user to specify an error message, (2) compatibility with BigQuery, (3) simplicity and clarity in what the function accomplishes. It is rather unusual for `assert` to return its input value, and it took me a while to parse what was actually happening here. I think the `ERROR` function is a cleaner solution that would be more understandable to users.\r\n\r\nApologies for not realizing the discussion happening there earlier. \r\n",

If the condition evaluates to `NULL` or `true`, it returns the input argument, if the condition evaluates to `false`, it throws an invalid input exception.\r\n\r\nThe `input` argument can be any type. The `condition` argument should evaluate to a boolean.\r\n \r\n\r\nExample for a failed assertion:\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 5 AS denom\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT 0 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\nInvalid Input Error: Assertion failed for assert(denom, (denom != 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for a verified assertion\r\n```\r\nSELECT 42 / denom\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT denom.assert(denom != 0) as denom\r\n  // OR assert(denom, denom != 0) as denom\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT 1 AS denom\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n----\r\n42\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Please let me know if I missed any details, to be able to support the any type, I could not use the existing utility functions.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

The first phase is moving away from `std::vector` to our class (which is derived from std::vector), and the next phase will be to introduce the safety check.\r\n\r\nThe safety check will likely incur some performance issues where vectors are being indexed heavily, and will require some profiling to figure out where this happens.\r\nThat's the main reason for doing this in two phases",

They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "Yes, I did a slight rework in the perfect aggregate HT by essentially calling the `initialize` for all groups up-front instead of lazily while adding chunks. The reason I did that was that the code previously relied on using `memcpy` in the combine phase if the aggregate was set in one of the hash tables, but not in the other hash table. This caused problems with the new arena allocator since it would copy over the pointers to the arena allocator of the old hash table instead of moving the data to the new hash table, and would then cause use-after-free later. In the new setup, we can just always call combine since there is always a correctly initialized empty state in each bucket.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR implements `TupleDataCollection`, an (even) more unified way of materializing data in row format.\r\n\r\nIn various places in DuckDB's execution engine, we materialize data in row format using `RowDataCollection` and `RowLayout`. While this is already a somewhat unified way of materializing data in row format, it has a few issues when we want to spill the row data to disk. The pointers within the row format have to be manually (un)swizzled when (un)pinned. This is cumbersome and requires some serious bookkeeping within physical operators that use row format data. This (un)swizzling may also be redundant if the blocks that hold the data are never written to disk, which may happen in cases where the data size is only slightly over the memory limit.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the `TupleDataCollection` class that, similar to the `ColumnDataCollection` class (#4315), `DataChunk`s can simply be appended or scanned, without the need to explicitly hold buffer pins in various places in the code. This is all managed by the `TupleDataAllocator` class. The two problems described above (regarding pointer swizzling) are addressed in a similar way to how pointers in a `ColumnDataCollection` are never explicitly swizzled (#5543). In short, we simply compare pointers to see whether the block was spilled to disk. If the pointers are different, we recompute them, if the pointers are the same, they are still valid and nothing needs to be done.\r\n\r\n`TupleDataCollection` has been integrated in `JoinHashTable` and `AggregateHashTable`, and should be integrated into the sorting code before the old `RowDataCollection` can be phased out. At that point I would like to rename `TupleDataCollection` to `RowDataCollection` for more consistency with naming in the code base.\r\n\r\nThis PR also brings improvements to the out-of-core hash join, and should improve the out-of-core capabilities of the hash aggregate. To improve the out-of-core hash join, I've implemented `PartitionedTupleData`, which, similar to `PartitionedColumnData` (#4970), we can append `DataChunk`s to, directly to the partitions. Rather than materializing all data in a single `TupleDataCollection`, we now immediately materialize to 16 partitions. If all data fits in memory, we combine the partitions into one, and perform an in-memory hash join. If not all data fits in memory, we combine as many partitions as fit in memory into one, and do a partitioned hash join like before. If a single one of the 16 partitions does not fit in memory, we repartition to up to 256 partitions, and perform the out-of-core hash join like before.\r\n\r\nI've ran the same benchmark as in the previous PRs (linked above):\r\n\r\n| Memory limit (GB) | Old time (s) | New time (s) |\r\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------|\r\n| 10                | 1.74         | 1.56         |\r\n| 5                 | 2.47         | 2.09         |\r\n| 3                 | 4.54         | 3.64         |\r\n| 1                 | 4.80         | 3.66         |\r\n\r\nI got a bit side-tracked in this PR and vectorized some code in `hive_partitioning.cpp` and was able to improve the runtime of `to_parquet_partition_by_many.benchmark` from ~2.95s to ~2.25s on my laptop.\r\n\r\nP.S.: I am definitely not done tweaking the performance of the hash join/aggregate, especially after speaking with Thomas Neumann here at ICDE. I look forward to optimizing these operators more in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso, this definitely has merge conflicts with #6995. Happy to fix them and merge this after that has been merged.\r\n",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "This PR improves the performance of the `LIST` aggregate in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Use an `ArenaAllocator` that is stored in the aggregate/perfect hash table to do the allocation of the list segments\r\n* Avoid storing the `AllocatedData` in a vector in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the provided allocator in the destructor to de-allocate the segments\r\n* Avoid allocating the root `LinkedList` and instead store this as part of the hash table\r\n* Avoid storing the `LogicalType` in the aggregate state of the list - instead use the type from the bind data\r\n\r\nThis results in many fewer allocations made, particularly when there are many small lists. They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

They also improve data locality as a result of using large heaps for the allocations. Here are some performance numbers for the two included benchmarks:\r\n\r\n|              Benchmark               |  Old  |  New  |\r\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\r\n| Many Small Lists (150K lists, 1-7 rows per list)   | 3.5s  | 0.06s |\r\n| Few Large Lists (3 lists, 140K - 300K rows per list) | 0.03s | 0.02s |\r\n\r\nThese changes require a few modifications to the aggregate hash tables and row layout, particularly to pass in the allocator from the hash table to the actual hash function:\r\n\r\n* The destroy function now also takes an `AggregateFunctionInput`\r\n* The `RowOperations` methods take a `RowOperationsState`, which contains an Allocator\r\n* The `AggregateHashTable` and `PerfectAggregateHashTable` are extended with an `ArenaAllocator` object\r\n\r\nFor the scan of the `PhysicalHashAggregate` we also launch multiple threads sooner - instead of only launching one thread per row group size we launch one thread per vector. Hash tables are scanned per-vector, and multiple threads processing the output of a hash table becomes beneficial already with low row counts when lists are involved.",

          "body": "Hi DuckDB team,\r\n\r\nI would like to implement the GeoSpatial data type in DuckDB. This will require quite a bit of work, so I propose breaking it up into two parts. The first part will be implementing the following, which will not be a ‘complete feature’ but I think would be good to get some feedback on making sure I am along the right path with the implementation. Here is how I would break it down:\r\n**Part 1** (partial implementation)\r\n- [ ] Support for the `POINT` geospatial object.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Constructor function, `ST_MAKEPOINT`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Input function, `ST_GEOGFROM`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Output function, `ST_ASTEXT`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Accessor function, `ST_X`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Calculation/main function, `ST_DISTANCE`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Transformation function, `ST_CENTROID`. (Note: this will return itself for a point, so for the time being it will be trivial).\r\n\r\nOnce I complete this I will discuss what I’ll work on for Part 2, but it will be adding basic support for the main geospatial objects, such as `LineString`, `Polygon`, `MultiPoint`, `MultiLineString`, `MultiPolygon`, and `GeometryCollection`, and adding some of the most common functions for each of the six function types, and provide suggestions for future improvements if someone want to continue on the work (such as adding in indexes or more functions).\r\nI will be using PostGIS and MySQL for references on open source implementations, though I think PostGIS is the standard here and since it works so well with Postgres, I will probably use that primarily for reference and copying over some of the main components.\r\n@Mytherin -- could you please review the above and let me know your thoughts on this?",

          "body": "> @Maxxen For the licensing part @Mytherin said we could use an extension with GPL license [#2836 (comment)](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/2836#issuecomment-1001706148). I really want a clarification from the duckdb team maybe the context changed since.\r\n\r\nWhile extensions can certainly have the GPL license (as the geo extension by @handstuyennn does), the GPL license invokes certain limitations that inhibit the extension from being used in several configurations where people would otherwise be able to use DuckDB.\r\n\r\nThis is more relevant to DuckDB than for a traditional database like Postgres. For Postgres, the database server operates as a separate application that the user uses a client library (psql) to talk to. For DuckDB, the user generally links to DuckDB directly and uses it as a library. This linking part is what is problematic - since GPL specifies that any applications [that links to GPL also need to be licensed as GPL.](https://opensource.org/license/gpl-2-0/).\r\n\r\n> This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.\r\n\r\nThis essentially prohibits people from creating an application that uses DuckDB with a GPL licensed extension incorporated, without also licensing their code as GPL. This same limitation would not apply to people using Postgres with the PostGIS library, since only the client library (`psql`) is linked to, which is not GPL licensed.\r\n\r\nThis is not relevant for people using the extension from within scripts like Python, so this does not prohibit all usages of the extension, and of course is totally fine if you are willing to license your own code as GPL. However, the license could prove to be problematic for people that want to build software on top of DuckDB with the extension, such that we would prefer to avoid these problems for the extensions that we actively support.\r\n\r\n> As an user, I don't want to have 2 extensions in this field. GeoSpacial is hard enough and I don't want to think on what extension I have to use.\r\n\r\nYes, it is unfortunate that there are now two extensions from a user perspective. The reason there are two extensions is that they prioritize different goals, as has been discussed earlier [here](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/5026#issuecomment-1283690932). The geo extension is heavily based on PostGIS code, and essentially enables the usage of PostGIS within DuckDB, which is awesome and very useful. It is, however, limited to being as good as PostGIS, as it is not tightly integrated with all of DuckDB's native capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe spatial extension instead has put a lot of work on making geospatial functionality natively integrated with DuckDB's internals, so it can operate more efficiently, with DuckDB's execution, data representation and memory management model in mind. Due to this, the spatial extension has the potential to become more powerful and efficient than PostGIS, but development also takes significantly longer as there is a lot more functionality to implement.\r\n\r\nThe Spatial extension also already provides additional features that PostGIS does not, such as the GDAL and PROJ integrations, and has put a lot of effort into packaging them in a portable way, so that it can be used in all contexts where DuckDB is used, including in e.g. the WASM builds.\r\n\r\nWe are definitely open to unifying the two extensions, and are aiming for the spatial extension to cover all of the functionality that you could expect from a GIS module. Unfortunately, we cannot just copy over the code from the geo extension due to licensing constraints. We would of course be happy to integrate the code and tests that @handstuyennn wrote themselves with their permission and work together on achieving a single awesome geospatial extension for DuckDB.\r\n",

          "body": "Hi DuckDB team,\r\n\r\nI would like to implement the GeoSpatial data type in DuckDB. This will require quite a bit of work, so I propose breaking it up into two parts. The first part will be implementing the following, which will not be a ‘complete feature’ but I think would be good to get some feedback on making sure I am along the right path with the implementation. Here is how I would break it down:\r\n**Part 1** (partial implementation)\r\n- [ ] Support for the `POINT` geospatial object.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Constructor function, `ST_MAKEPOINT`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Input function, `ST_GEOGFROM`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Output function, `ST_ASTEXT`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Accessor function, `ST_X`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Calculation/main function, `ST_DISTANCE`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Transformation function, `ST_CENTROID`. (Note: this will return itself for a point, so for the time being it will be trivial).\r\n\r\nOnce I complete this I will discuss what I’ll work on for Part 2, but it will be adding basic support for the main geospatial objects, such as `LineString`, `Polygon`, `MultiPoint`, `MultiLineString`, `MultiPolygon`, and `GeometryCollection`, and adding some of the most common functions for each of the six function types, and provide suggestions for future improvements if someone want to continue on the work (such as adding in indexes or more functions).\r\nI will be using PostGIS and MySQL for references on open source implementations, though I think PostGIS is the standard here and since it works so well with Postgres, I will probably use that primarily for reference and copying over some of the main components.\r\n@Mytherin -- could you please review the above and let me know your thoughts on this?",

Here is how I would break it down:\r\n**Part 1** (partial implementation)\r\n- [ ] Support for the `POINT` geospatial object.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Constructor function, `ST_MAKEPOINT`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Input function, `ST_GEOGFROM`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Output function, `ST_ASTEXT`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Accessor function, `ST_X`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Calculation/main function, `ST_DISTANCE`.\r\n- [ ] Support for one Transformation function, `ST_CENTROID`. (Note: this will return itself for a point, so for the time being it will be trivial).\r\n\r\nOnce I complete this I will discuss what I’ll work on for Part 2, but it will be adding basic support for the main geospatial objects, such as `LineString`, `Polygon`, `MultiPoint`, `MultiLineString`, `MultiPolygon`, and `GeometryCollection`, and adding some of the most common functions for each of the six function types, and provide suggestions for future improvements if someone want to continue on the work (such as adding in indexes or more functions).\r\nI will be using PostGIS and MySQL for references on open source implementations, though I think PostGIS is the standard here and since it works so well with Postgres, I will probably use that primarily for reference and copying over some of the main components.\r\n@Mytherin -- could you please review the above and let me know your thoughts on this?",

It's a lot easier to work with and a standard from OGC.\r\n\r\nAs an user, I don't want to have 2 extensions in this field. GeoSpacial is hard enough and I don't want to think on what extension I have to use.\r\n\r\n* :\r\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-geospatial\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types?hl=fr#geography_type\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/geospatial-overview.html ",

The first phase is moving away from `std::vector` to our class (which is derived from std::vector), and the next phase will be to introduce the safety check.\r\n\r\nThe safety check will likely incur some performance issues where vectors are being indexed heavily, and will require some profiling to figure out where this happens.\r\nThat's the main reason for doing this in two phases",

The first phase is moving away from `std::vector` to our class (which is derived from std::vector), and the next phase will be to introduce the safety check.\r\n\r\nThe safety check will likely incur some performance issues where vectors are being indexed heavily, and will require some profiling to figure out where this happens.\r\nThat's the main reason for doing this in two phases",
