## Installation

dlt supports Python 3.8+.

```bash
pip install dlt
```

## Quick Start

Load chess game data from chess.com API and save it in DuckDB:

```python
import dlt
import requests
# Create a dlt pipeline that will load
# chess player data to the DuckDB destination
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name='chess_pipeline',
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name='player_data'
)
# Grab some player data from Chess.com API
data = []
for player in ['magnuscarlsen', 'rpragchess']:
    response = requests.get(f'https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{player}')
    response.raise_for_status()
    data.append(response.json())
# Extract, normalize, and load the data
pipeline.run(data, table_name='player')
```
