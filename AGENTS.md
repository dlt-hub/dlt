# dlt principles
- This is a mature library used by thousands of the best engineers in the world
- dlt is a library, not a platform. users add it to their code. we respect existing workflows and other libraries they use
- no black boxes: clean, minimal Pythonic interfaces, human readable file formats, no side effects, documentation
- multiply - don't add: we do more work here so our users do less.

# dlt repo
- we use `uv` and `uv run`. look in @Makefile
- we branch from `devel` for feature branches
