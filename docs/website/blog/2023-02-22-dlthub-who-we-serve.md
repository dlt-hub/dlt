The number of Python developers increased from [7 million in 2017](https://adtmag.com/articles/2018/09/24/developer-economics-survey.aspx) to [15.7 million in Q1 2021](https://slashdata-website-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/sample_reports/VZtJWxZw5Q9NDSAQ.pdf) and grew by [3 million (20%) between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 alone](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), making it the [most popular programming language in Q3 2022](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022). A large percentage of this new group are what we call **Python practitioners**—[data folks and scripters](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2021/#PurposesUsingPython). This group uses Python to do tasks in their jobs, but they do not consider themselves to be software engineers.

They are entering modern organizations in masse. Organizations often [employ them for data-related jobs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022), especially in data engineering, data science / ML, and analytics. They must work with established data sources, data stores, and data pipelines that are essential to the business of these organizations These companies, though, are not providing them with the type of tooling they learnt to expect. There’s no “Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, etc. for data loading” for them to use.

At this stage of dlt we are focused on serving the needs of organizations with 150 employees or less. Companies of this size typically begin making their first data hires. They want data to be at their core: their CEOs may want to make their companies more “data driven” and “user feedback centric”. Their CTOs may want to “build a data warehouse for automation and self service”. They frequently are eager to take advantage of the skills of the Python practioners they have hired.

To achieve our mission of making this next generation of Python users autonomous in these organizations, we believe we need to build dlt in a “Pythonic” way. Anyone that can write a loop in Python script should be able to write a source and load it. There should minimal learning curve. Anyone in these organizations that gets basic Python should be able to use dlt right away.

However, we also recognize the need dlt to be loved not only by Python users but also data engineers to fulfill our mission. This is crucial because eventually these folks will be brought in to help with data loading in an organization. We need data engineers to evolve dlt pipelines rather than ripping them out and replacing them like they almost always do to scripts written by Python practitioners today. 

To develop with dlt, anyone can install it like any other Python library with `pip install python-dlt`. They can then run `dlt init` and be ready to go. Already today data engineers love the automatic schema inference and evolution as well as the customizability of dlt.
