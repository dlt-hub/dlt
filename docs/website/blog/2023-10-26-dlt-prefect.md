## dlt

dlt is an open-source library that you can add to your Python scripts to load data from various and
often messy data sources into well-structured, live datasets. It abstracts away the need to hunt
through docs, interpret APIs, and reinvent the wheel every time. Instead of writing a custom pipeline,
you can use dlt to build a framework for your pipelines for any combination of tools.

### Moving Slack data into BigQuery

We use BigQuery as our data warehouse, and try to centralize as much information there as possible.
Given our Slack community is over 25,000 people, it makes sense to use that information to better our
community. We can identify the types of questions our users struggle with the most, and take action to
improve Prefect by using Slack data.

If you Google “load Slack into BigQuery,” you’ll see a bunch of listings for no-code tools like
Zapier that can help you move data… for a fee, of course. What if you want to do this yourself?
Slack has an API, but [check it out](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list).
It would take some effort to interpret even a simple response like this one for users:

```json
{
    "ok": true,
    "members": [
        {
            "id": "W012A3CDE",
            "team_id": "T012AB3C4",

            },
            "is_admin": true,
            "is_owner": false,

            "has_2fa": false
        }
    ]
}
```
### With dlt
You can use dlt to build a Slack to BigQuery pipeline in just a few seconds with a single command.
Seriously, it is that simple.
In preparation, let’s make sure to install what we need:

```sh
pip install dlt
pip install prefect
````

Then just run a simple init command:

```sh

dlt init slack bigquery
```
In the `.dlt/secrets.toml` file, enter your Slack and BigQuery credentials:

```toml
[sources.slack]
access_token="*****"

[destinations.bigquery]
location = "US"

[destination.bigquery.credentials]
project_id = "*****"
private_key = "*****"
client_email = "*****"
```

With a single command + adding some credentials,
we now have the framework of a pipeline! [Look at what has been generated](https://github.com/dylanbhughes/dlt_slack_pipeline/blob/main/slack_pipeline.py),
with a couple of small customizations:

Note that we are redacting some of the code in the preview for brevity,
to follow along completely navigate to the repo.


```py
# Pipeline to load Slack into BigQuery

from typing import List

import dlt
import pendulum

from slack import slack_source

def load_channels() -> None:
    """Execute a pipeline that will load a list of all the Slack channels in the workspace to BigQuery"""
    # ...

def get_resources() -> List[str]:
    """Fetch a list of available dlt resources so we can fetch them one at a time"""
    # ...

def load_channel_history(channel: str, start_date: Date) -> None:
    """Execute a pipeline that will load the given Slack channel incrementally beginning at the given start date."""
    # ...

def get_users() -> None:
    """Execute a pipeline that will load Slack users list."""
    # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    channels = None
    start_date = pendulum.now().subtract(days=1).date()

    load_channels()

    resources = get_resources()
    for resource in resources:
        if channels is not None and resource not in channels:
            continue

        load_channel_history(resource, start_date=start_date)

    get_users()
```

### What if it fails?
Great, we’ve got a pipeline that moves data from Slack to BigQuery,
and we didn’t have to format any JSON - that alone is a win.
However, there may be some issues. What if Slack rate limits you?
What if BigQuery is down (😅)? What about a networking issue?
What if the execution environment where this script lives isn’t working?

These questions are the difference between a pipeline and a resilient pipeline.
They’re the difference between you getting sleep at night and you looking like a hero (or a dummy)
to your stakeholders.


## Adding Prefect

Prefect is a workflow orchestration tool for turning your pipelines into scheduled, repeatable,
and resilient workflows. With Prefect you get scheduling, observability, and automations
that can make sure your pipelines aren’t causing you stress in the middle of the night.

Make sure you’re logged in to Prefect Cloud by [signing up](https://app.prefect.cloud/?utm_source=dltblog)
and using the following command:

```sh
prefect cloud login
```
Luckily, Prefect is also incredibly Pythonic. Turning any pipeline into an observable, scheduled
Prefect flow is as simple as adding decorators to your functions and `serving` it up.
Here’s our `dlt` generated pipeline, scheduled daily:

```py
from typing import List

import dlt
import pendulum
from prefect import flow, task
from slack import slack_source

@task
def load_channels() -> None:
   ...

@task
def get_resources() -> List[str]:
   ...

@task
def load_channel_history(channel: str, start_date: pendulum.Date) -> None:
   ...

@task
def get_users() -> None:
   ...

@flow
def slack_pipeline(
    channels=None, start_date=pendulum.now().subtract(days=1).date()
) -> None:
    load_channels()

    resources = get_resources()
    for resource in resources:
        if channels is not None and resource not in channels:
            continue

        load_channel_history(resource, start_date=start_date)

    get_users()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    slack_pipeline.serve("slack_pipeline", cron="0 0 * * *")
```

We’ve added `@task` to our individual functions.
These will be treated as individual units of work by Prefect when they are executed.
We decorate our primary function (slack_pipeline) with @flow, which references
our task functions. We will schedule and kick off flows, which in turn will
execute tasks based on the decorators within them.

Finally, adding `.serve` to our `if __name__ == "__main__":` call means that a Prefect
deployment will be automatically created and scheduled to run daily at noon. We can
see our deployment and scheduled runs in the [Prefect UI](https://app.prefect.cloud), and we’ll know when it ran or,
more importantly, if they didn't. We can further extend our pipeline by:

- Setting up [remote infrastructure with workers](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/tutorial/workers/)
- [Adding automations](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/automations/) to notify us when the pipeline has failed
- [Setting up retries](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/tasks/#custom-retry-behavior)

### Where to handle failure

There are many levels of failure, you could say, from "accidentally liking your ex's social media post from five years ago" to "trying to assemble IKEA furniture without instructions," up to "asking for the Wi-Fi password at a funeral." So which ones should we handle where, and what are some quick solutions?

With dlt, your pipelines are resilient at the API level. From [schema changes](https://dlthub.com/docs/blog/schema-evolution)
to network issues or [memory overflow](https://dlthub.com/docs/reference/performance#memorydisk-management),
there is automated resiliency and recovery that is specific to working with the pesky APIs of your tools.

With Prefect, your pipelines become resilient at the function level.
If your workflows never run, break and fail, [or break and never end](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/api-ref/server/api/flow_runs/?h=lateness#prefect.server.api.flow_runs.average_flow_run_lateness), Prefect will be your backstop -
notifying you and taking the appropriate action in case of failure.

### Building resilient pipelines faster with dlt + Prefect
Getting into production is hard. First you need to build your pipeline, and then you need to make it
resilient. With this tutorial, we’ve shown you how to quickly build pipelines with dlt and then turn
that pipeline into a resilient, repeatable workflow with Prefect.

Prefect makes complex workflows simpler, not harder.
