[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is a user-friendly e-commerce solution that enables anyone to easily create and manage their
own online store.

This Shopify `dlt` verified source and
[pipeline example](https://github.com/dlt-hub/verified-sources/blob/master/sources/shopify_dlt_pipeline.py)
loads data using “Shopify API” to the destination of your choice.

The resources that this verified source supports are:

| Name      | Description                                                                         |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| customers | Individuals or entities who have created accounts on a Shopify-powered online store |
| orders    | Transactions made by customers on an online store                                   |
| products  | The individual items or goods that are available for sale                           |

## Setup Guide

### Grab credentials

#### Grab API token

1. Log in to Shopify.
1. Click the settings icon⚙️ at the bottom left.
1. Choose “Apps and sales channels.”
1. Select the “Develop apps” tab.
1. Click “Create an app” and enter app details.
1. Go to “Configuration” and choose “Configure” under “Admin API integration."
1. Grant read access in “Admin API access scopes.”
1. Save the configuration.
1. Hit “Install app” and confirm.
1. Reveal and copy the Admin API token from “secrets.toml”. Store safely; it's shown only once.

> Note: The Shopify UI, which is described here, might change.
The full guide is available at [this link.](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/17056443-how-to-generate-a-shopify-api-token)

### Initialize the verified source

To get started with your data pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Enter the following command:

   ```bash
   dlt init shopify_dlt duckdb
   ```

   [This command](../../reference/command-line-interface) will initialize
   [the pipeline example](https://github.com/dlt-hub/verified-sources/blob/master/sources/shopify_dlt_pipeline.py)
   with Shopify as the [source](../../general-usage/source) and [duckdb](../destinations/duckdb.md)
   as the [destination](../destinations).

1. If you'd like to use a different destination, simply replace `duckdb` with the name of your
   preferred [destination](../destinations).

1. After running this command, a new directory will be created with the necessary files and
   configuration settings to get started.

For more information, read the
[Walkthrough: Add a verified source.](../../walkthroughs/add-a-verified-source)

### Add credential

1. Inside the `.dlt` folder, you'll find a file called `secrets.toml`, which is where you can
   securely store your access tokens and other sensitive information. It's important to handle this
   file with care and keep it safe.

   Here's what the file looks like:

      ```toml
      #shopify
      [sources.shopify_dlt]
      private_app_password=" Please set me up !" #Admin API access token copied above
      ```

1. Update `private_app_password` with the `API access token` that
   [you copied above](shopify.md#grab-api-token).

1. Next, store your pipeline configuration details in the `.dlt/config.toml`.

   Here's what the `config.toml` looks like:

   ```toml
   [sources.shopify_dlt]
   shop_url = "Please set me up !" # please set me up!
   ```

1. Update `shop_url` with the URL of your Shopify store. For example,
   "https://shop-123.myshopify.com/%E2%80%9D".

1. Next, follow the [destination documentation](../../dlt-ecosystem/destinations) instructions to
   add credentials for your chosen destination, ensuring proper routing of your data to the final
   destination.

For more information, read the [General Usage: Credentials.](../../general-usage/credentials)

## Run the pipeline

1. Before running the pipeline, ensure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies by
   running the command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
1. You're now ready to run the pipeline! To get started, run the following command:
   ```bash
   python shopify_dlt_pipeline.py
   ```
1. Once the pipeline has finished running, you can verify that everything loaded correctly by using
   the following command:
   ```bash
   dlt pipeline <pipeline_name> show
   ```
   For example, the `pipeline_name` for the above pipeline example is `shopify_data`, you may also
   use any custom name instead.

For more information, read the [Walkthrough: Run a pipeline.](../../walkthroughs/run-a-pipeline)

## Sources and resources

`dlt` works on the principle of [sources](../../general-usage/source) and
[resources](../../general-usage/resource).

### Source `shopify_source`:

This function returns a list of resources to load products, orders, and customers data from Shopify
API.

```python
def shopify_source(
    private_app_password: str = dlt.secrets.value,
    api_version: str = DEFAULT_API_VERSION,
    shop_url: str = dlt.config.value,
    start_date: TAnyDateTime = FIRST_DAY_OF_MILLENNIUM,
    end_date: Optional[TAnyDateTime] = None,
    created_at_min: TAnyDateTime = FIRST_DAY_OF_MILLENNIUM,
    items_per_page: int = DEFAULT_ITEMS_PER_PAGE,
    order_status: TOrderStatus = "any",
) -> Iterable[DltResource]:
```

`private_app_password`: App's password for your shop.

`api_version`: API version (e.g., 2023-01).

`shop_url`: Your shop's URL (e.g., https://my-shop.myshopify.com).

`items_per_page`: Max items fetched per page (Default: 250).

`start_date`: Imports items updated since this date (Default: 2000-01-01). Used for incremental
loading if end_time isn't specified. Accepts ISO 8601 date/datetime formats.

`end_time`: Data load range end time. Paired with start_date for specified time range. Enables
incremental loading if unspecified.

`created_at_min`: Load items created since this date (Default: 2000-01-01).

`order_status`: Filter for order status: 'open', 'closed', 'cancelled', 'any' (Default: 'any').

### Resource `products`:

This resource loads products from your Shopify shop into the destination. It supports incremental
loading and pagination.

```python
@dlt.resource(primary_key="id", write_disposition="merge")
def products(
    updated_at: dlt.sources.incremental[
        pendulum.DateTime
    ] = dlt.sources.incremental(
        "updated_at",
        initial_value=start_date_obj,
        end_value=end_date_obj,
        allow_external_schedulers=True,
    ),
    created_at_min: pendulum.DateTime = created_at_min_obj,
    items_per_page: int = items_per_page,
) -> Iterable[TDataItem]:
```

`updated_at`: The saved [state](../../general-usage/state) of the last 'updated_at' value.

Similar to the mentioned resource, there are two more resources "orders" and "customers", both
support incremental loading and pagination.

## Customization

### Create your own pipeline

If you wish to create your own pipelines, you can leverage source and resource methods from this
verified source.

1. Configure the pipeline by specifying the pipeline name, destination, and dataset as follows:

   ```python
   pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
       pipeline_name="shopify",  # Use a custom name if desired
       destination="duckdb",  # Choose the appropriate destination (e.g., duckdb, redshift, post)
       dataset_name="shopify_data"  # Use a custom name if desired
   )
   ```

   To read more about pipeline configuration, please refer to our
   [documentation](../../general-usage/pipeline).

1. To load data from "products", "orders" and "customers" from 1st Jan 2023.

   ```python
   # Add your desired resources to the list...
   resources = ["products", "orders", "customers"]
   start_date="2023-01-01"

   load_data = shopify_source(start_date=start_date).with_resources(*resources)
   load_info = pipeline.run(load_data)
   print(load_info)
   ```

1. To load past Shopify orders in weekly chunks using start_date and end_date parameters. This
   minimizes potential failure during large data loads. Running chunks and incremental loads in
   parallel accelerates the initial load.

   ```python
   # Load all orders from 2023-01-01 to now
   min_start_date = current_start_date = pendulum.datetime(2023, 1, 1)
   max_end_date = pendulum.now()
   # Create a list of time ranges of 1 week each, we'll use this to load the data in chunks
   ranges: List[Tuple[pendulum.DateTime, pendulum.DateTime]] = []
   while current_start_date < max_end_date:
        end_date = min(current_start_date.add(weeks=1), max_end_date)
        ranges.append((current_start_date, end_date))
        current_start_date = end_date

   for start_date, end_date in ranges:
        print(f"Load orders between {start_date} and {end_date}")
        # Create the source with start and end date set according to the current time range to filter
        # created_at_min lets us set a cutoff to exclude orders created before the initial date of (2023-01-01)
        # even if they were updated after that date
        load_data = shopify_source(
            start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date, created_at_min=min_start_date
        ).with_resources("orders")

        load_info = pipeline.run(load_data)
        print(load_info)
   # Continue loading new data incrementally starting at the end of the last range
   # created_at_min still filters out items created before 2023-01-01
   load_info = pipeline.run(
        shopify_source(
            start_date=max_end_date, created_at_min=min_start_date
        ).with_resources("orders")
   )
   print(load_info)
   ```
