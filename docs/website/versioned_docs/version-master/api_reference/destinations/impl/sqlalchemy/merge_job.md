```python
class SqlalchemyMergeFollowupJob(SqlMergeFollowupJob)
```

[[view_source]](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt/blob/f0690715274590fc4cacf1165e3661aaa7af1c15/dlt/destinations/impl/sqlalchemy/merge_job.py#L21)

Uses SQLAlchemy to generate merge SQL statements.
Result is equivalent to the SQL generated by `SqlMergeFollowupJob`
except for delete-insert we use concrete tables instead of temporary tables.
