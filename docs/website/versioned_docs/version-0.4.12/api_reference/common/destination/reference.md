Represents a runnable job that loads a single file

Each job starts in "running" state and ends in one of terminal states: "retry", "failed" or "completed".
Each job is uniquely identified by a file name. The file is guaranteed to exist in "running" state. In terminal state, the file may not be present.
In "running" state, the loader component periodically gets the state via `status()` method. When terminal state is reached, load job is discarded and not called again.
`exception` method is called to get error information in "failed" and "retry" states.

The `__init__` method is responsible to put the Job in "running" state. It may raise `LoadClientTerminalException` and `LoadClientTransientException` to
immediately transition job into "failed" or "retry" state respectively.

```python

If set to True, and staging destination is configured, the data will be loaded to staging dataset on staging destination
instead of a regular dataset on staging destination. Currently it is used by Athena Iceberg which uses staging dataset
on staging destination to copy data to iceberg tables stored on regular dataset on staging destination.
The default is to load data to regular dataset on staging destination from where warehouses like Snowflake (that have their
own storage) will copy data.

### should\_truncate\_table\_before\_load\_on\_staging\_destination

```python
@abstractmethod
def should_truncate_table_before_load_on_staging_destination(
        table: TTableSchema) -> bool

If set to True, data in `table` will be truncated on staging destination (regular dataset). This is the default behavior which
can be changed with a config flag.
For Athena + Iceberg this setting is always False - Athena uses regular dataset to store Iceberg tables and we avoid touching it.
For Athena we truncate those tables only on "replace" write disposition.
