Creates a list of sources for data items present in `data` and applies specified hints to all resources.

`data` may be a DltSource, DltResource, a list of those or any other data type accepted by pipeline.run

## describe\_extract\_data

```python
def describe_extract_data(data: Any) -> List[ExtractDataInfo]
```

Extract source and resource names from data passed to extract

## Extract Objects

```python
class Extract(WithStepInfo[ExtractMetrics, ExtractInfo])
```

### original\_data

Original data from which the extracted DltSource was created. Will be used to describe in extract info

### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(schema_storage: SchemaStorage,
             normalize_storage_config: NormalizeStorageConfiguration,
             collector: Collector = NULL_COLLECTOR,
             original_data: Any = None) -> None
```

optionally saves originally extracted `original_data` to generate extract info

### commit\_packages
