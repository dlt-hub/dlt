dlt+ provides a powerful mechanism for executing transformations on your data using a locally spun-up cache. It automatically creates and manages the cache before execution and cleans it up afterward.

A transformation consists of functions that modify data stored in a [cache](../../core-concepts/cache.md). These transformations can be implemented using:

* [dbt models](./dbt-transformations.md)
* [ðŸ§ª Python user-defined functions](./python-transformations.md)

By combining a cache and transformations, you can efficiently process data loaded via dlt and move it to a new destination.

:::caution
Local transformations are currently limited to specific use cases and are only compatible with data stored in filesystem-based destinations:

* [Iceberg](../../ecosystem/iceberg.md)
* [Delta](../../ecosystem/delta.md)
* [Cloud storage and filesystem](../../../dlt-ecosystem/destinations/filesystem.md)

Make sure to specify a dataset located in a filesystem-based destination when [defining a cache](#defining-cache).
:::

To use this feature, follow these steps:

1. [Configure the `dlt.yml` file](#configure-dltyml-file): define a cache and specify transformations.
2. [Generate scaffolding](#generate-scaffolding): automatically create transformation templates.
3. [Modify transformations](#modify-transformations): update the generated Python functions or dbt models.
4. [Run transformations](#run-transformations): execute them on your data.

## Configure `dlt.yml` file

Before setting up the transformations in the `dlt.yml` file, you need to make sure you have defined the cache.

### Defining the cache

You can find detailed instructions on how to define a cache in the [cache core concept](../../core-concepts/cache.md#define-the-cache). Here's an example:

```yaml
caches:
  github_events_cache:
    inputs:
      - dataset: github_events_dataset
        tables:
          items: items
    outputs:
      - dataset: github_events_dataset
        tables:
          items: items
          items_aggregated: items_aggregated
```

:::caution
Please make sure that the input dataset for the cache is located in a filesystem-based destination ([Iceberg](../../ecosystem/iceberg.md), [Delta](../../ecosystem/delta.md), or [Cloud storage and filesystem](../../../dlt-ecosystem/destinations/filesystem.md)).
:::

### Defining transformations

Specify transformations in `dlt.yml` with the following parameters:

* unique identifier for the transformation.
* engine â€“ choose between:
  * `arrow` for Python-based transformations
  * `dbt` for dbt-based transformations
* cache â€“ the cache that the transformation will run on.

For example,

```yaml
transformations:
  github_events_transformations:
    engine: dbt
    cache: github_events_cache
```

## Generate scaffolding

To create transformation scaffolding based on your dlt pipeline:

1. Run the dlt pipeline at least once; this ensures dlt has the dataset schemas.
2. Execute the following CLI command:

```sh
dlt transformation <transformation-name> render-t-layer
```

This will generate transformation files inside the `./transformations` folder. Depending on the engine:

* For Python transformations: a Python script with transformation functions ([learn more](./python-transformations.md))
* For dbt transformations: dbt models ([learn more](./dbt-transformations.md))

Each generated transformation includes models for managing incremental loading states via `dlt_load_id`.

## Modify transformations

Now you can update the generated transformations and create new ones to reflect the desired behavior. We recommend keeping the incremental approach as in the generated models.

## Run transformations

dlt+ offers comprehensive CLI support for executing transformations. You can find the full list of available commands in the [command line interface](../../reference.md).

To run the defined transformation, use the [following command](../../reference.md#dlt-transformation-run):

```sh
dlt transformation <transformation_name> run
```

This command populates the local cache, applies the defined transformations, and then flushes the transformed tables to the specified destination.
