[dlt+ Project](../project/overview.md) is a structured, opinionated framework for managing data workflows. It automates essential tasks like data loading, transformations, quality checks, and governance, so data teams can collaborate more effectively and ship faster.

Define everything in a declarative dlt.yml, manage [profiles](../project/overview.md#profiles) for different environments, ensure quality with built-in test utilities, and prepare for packaging your project as a [Python package](../project/python-api.md).
