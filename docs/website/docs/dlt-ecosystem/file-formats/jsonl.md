# jsonl - JSON delimited
`JSON delimited` is a file format that stores several `JSON` documents in one file. The `JSON` documents are separated by a new line.

Additional data types are stored as follows:
* `datetime` and `date` as ISO strings
* `decimal` as text representation of decimal number
* `binary` is base64 encoded string
* `HexBytes` is hex encoded string
* `complex` is serialized as a string

This file format is [compressed](../../reference/performance.md#disabling-and-enabling-file-compression) by default.

## Supported destinations
Used by default by: **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **filesystem**

By setting the `loader_file_format` argument to `jsonl` in the run command, the pipeline will store your data in the jsonl format to the destination:

```python
info = pipeline.run(some_source(), loader_file_format="jsonl")
```
