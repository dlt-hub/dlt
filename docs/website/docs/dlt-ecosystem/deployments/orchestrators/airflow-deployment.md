# Deployment with Airflow and Google Cloud Composer

[Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) is like your personal assistant for managing data workflows.
It's a cool open-source platform that lets you create and schedule complex data pipelines. You can
break down your tasks into smaller chunks, set dependencies between them, and keep an eye on how
everything's running.

[Google Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer) is a Google Cloud managed Airflow, which
allows you to use Airflow without having to deploy it. It costs the same as you would run your own,
except all the kinks and inefficiencies have mostly been ironed out. The latest version they offer
features autoscaling which helps reduce cost further by shutting down unused workers.

Combining Airflow, `dlt`, and Google Cloud Composer is a game-changer. You can supercharge your data
pipelines by leveraging Airflow's workflow management features, enhancing them with `dlt`'s
specialized templates, and enjoying the scalability and reliability of Google Cloud Composer's
managed environment. It's the ultimate combo for handling data integration, transformation, and
loading tasks like a pro.

`dlt` makes it super convenient to deploy your data load script and integrate it seamlessly with
your Airflow workflow in Google Cloud Composer. It's all about simplicity and getting things done
with just a few keystrokes.

For this easy style of deployment, `dlt` supports
[the cli command](../../../reference/command-line-interface.md#airflow-composer):

```bash
dlt deploy {pipeline_script}.py airflow-composer
```

which generates the necessary code and instructions.
