# Arrow Table / Pandas

You can load data directly from an Arrow table or Pandas dataframe.
This is supported by all destinations that support the parquet file format (e.g. [Snowflake](../destinations/snowflake.md) and [Filesystem](../destinations/filesystem.md)).

This is a more performant way to load structured data since `dlt`` bypasses many processing steps normally involved in passing JSON objects through the pipeline.
`dlt` automatically translates the Arrow table's schema to the destination table's schema and writes the table to a parquet file which gets uploaded to the destination without any further processing.

## Usage

To write an Arrow source, pass any `pyarrow.Table`, `pyarrow.RecordBatch` or `pandas.DataFrame` object (or list of thereof) to the pipeline's `run` or `extract` method, or yield table(s)/dataframe(s) from a `@dlt.resource` decorated function.

This example loads a Pandas dataframe to a Snowflake table:

```python
import dlt
from dlt.common import pendulum
import pandas as pd


df = pd.DataFrame({
    "order_id": [1, 2, 3],
    "customer_id": [1, 2, 3],
    "ordered_at": [pendulum.DateTime(2021, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6), pendulum.DateTime(2021, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6), pendulum.DateTime(2021, 1, 6, 4, 5, 6)],
    "order_amount": [100.0, 200.0, 300.0],
})

pipeline = dlt.pipeline("orders_pipeline", destination="snowflake")

pipeline.run([df], table_name="orders")
```

A `pyarrow` table can be loaded in the same way:

```python
import pyarrow as pa

# Create dataframe and pipeline same as above
...

table = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
pipeline.run([table], table_name="orders")
```

Note: The data in the table must be compatible with the destination database as no data conversion is performed. Refer to the documentation of the destination for information about supported data types.

## Destinations that support parquet for direct loading
* duckdb & motherduck
* redshift
* bigquery
* snowflake
* filesystem
* athena

## Incremental loading with Arrow tables

You can use incremental loading with Arrow tables as well.
Usage is the same as without other dlt resources. Refer to the [incremental loading](/general-usage/incremental-loading.md) guide for more information.

Example:

```python
import dlt
from dlt.common import pendulum
import pandas as pd

# Create a resource using that yields a dataframe, using the `ordered_at` field as an incremental cursor
@dlt.resource(primary_key="order_id")
def orders(ordered_at = dlt.sources.incremental('ordered_at'))
    # Get dataframe/arrow table from somewhere
    # If your database supports it, you can use the last_value to filter data at the source.
    # Otherwise it will be filtered automatically after loading the data.
    df = get_orders(since=ordered_at.last_value)
    yield df

pipeline = dlt.pipeline("orders_pipeline", destination="snowflake")
pipeline.run(orders)
# Run again to load only new data
pipeline.run(orders)
```

## Supported Arrow data types

The Arrow data types are translated to dlt data types as follows:

| Arrow type        | dlt type    | Notes                                                      |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `string`          | `text`      |                                                            |
| `float`/`double`  | `double`    |                                                            |
| `boolean`         | `bool`      |                                                            |
| `timestamp`       | `timestamp` | Precision is determined by the unit of the timestamp.      |
| `date`            | `date`      |                                                            |
| `time<bit_width>` | `time`      | Precision is determined by the unit of the time.           |
| `int<bit_width>`  | `bigint`    | Precision is determined by the bit width.                  |
| `binary`          | `binary`    |                                                            |
| `decimal`         | `decimal`   | Precision and scale are determined by the type properties. |
| `struct`          | `complex`   |                                                            |
|                   |             |                                                            |
