import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

Pick one of our verified sources that we wrote or maintain ourselves. Many of them already in production. All of them are constantly tested on real data and distributed as simple Python code so they can be easily customized or hacked.

* Need more info? [Join our Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/dlthub-community/shared_invite/zt-1n5193dbq-rCBmJ6p~ckpSFK4hCF2dYA) and ask in the tech help channel or [Talk to an engineer](https://calendar.app.google/kiLhuMsWKpZUpfho6)

Do you plan to run dlt in production and source is missing? We are happy to build it.
* Source missing? [Request a new verified source](https://github.com/dlt-hub/verified-sources/issues/new?template=source-request.md)
* Missing endpoint or a feature? [Request or contribute](https://github.com/dlt-hub/verified-sources/issues/new?template=extend-a-source.md)

Otherwise pick a source below:
