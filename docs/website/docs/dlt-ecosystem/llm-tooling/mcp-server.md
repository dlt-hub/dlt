# MCP Server

Currently, dltHub is [building two MCP servers](https://dlthub.com/blog/deep-dive-assistants-mcp-continue) that you can run locally and integrate with your preferred IDE. One server is for the open-source `dlt` library and the other integrates with `dlt+` features ([Learn more](../../plus/features/ai.md)).

This page gives an overview of what we're building and includes detailed instructions to install the MCP in your favorite IDE.

## Model Context Protocol
The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is a standard initiated by Anthropic to connect large language models (LLMs) to external data and systems.

In the context of the MCP, the **client** is built-in the user-facing application. The most common clients are LLM-enabled IDEs or extensions such as Continue, Cursor, Claude Desktop, Cline, etc. The  **server** is a process that handles requests to interact with external data and systems.

### Core constructs

- **Resources** are data objects that can be retrieved by the client and added to the context (i.e., prompt) of the LLM request. Resources will be manually selected by the user, or certain clients will automatically retrieved them.

- **Tools** provided a way to execute code and provide information to the LLM. Tools are called by the LLM; they can't be selected by the user or the client. 

- **Prompts** are strings, or templated strings, that can be injected in the conversation. Prompts are selected by the user. They provide shortcuts for frequent commands, or allow to ask the LLMs to use specific tools.


:::note
The MCP is progressively being adopted and not all clients support all the features used by the dlt MCP server. See [this page](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) for an overview of client capabilities

## Features

The dlt and dlt+ MCP servers aim to be a toolbox to help developers build, maintain, and operate `dlt` pipelines. There are two primary avenues:

- **Code generation**: LLMs are good at writing Python code, but they don't know everything about `dlt`. The MCP provides resources and tools to provide up-to-date information to the LLm about the dlt library and the specifics of your project.

- **Assistance**: The MCP resources, tools, and prompts can also be used to learn more about `dlt`. The built-in knowledgebase combined with your project's context brings Q&A support inside your IDE.

The next sections are a non-exhaustive documentation of existing and upcoming features.

### Tools

- Pipeline metadata: read your pipeline directory (default: `~/.dlt/pipelines`) to know available pipelines, available tables, table schemas.

- Operational metadata: read your pipeline directory to identify last load date, schema changes, load errors, and inspect load packages.

- dlt configuration: use an instantiated pipeline to inspect the dlt configuration (sources, resources, destinations).

- Datasets: connect to the destination and execute SQL queries to retrieve data tables via light text-to-SQL.


### Resources

- LLM-optimized dlt documentation pages. These can be selected and added to your prompt to help the LLM generate valid `dlt` code.

### Prompts

- Tutorial-like instructions that puts the LLM in "assistant mode". For example, the LLM can ask you questions about your data and "think" with you to select the right loading strategy.

- Command-like instructions that gives the LLM a task to complete. For example, the LLM can initialize a new pipeline. This is akin to a conversational command line tool.


## Installation

The `dlt` and `dlt+` MCP servers are intended to run locally on your machine and communicate over standard I/O. Typically, the MCP server process is launched by the MCP client, i.e., the IDE. We will use the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) to launch the MCP server.

The next sections include client-specific instructions, references, and snippets to configure the MCP server. They are mainly derived from this `uv` command:

```sh
uv tool run --with "dlt-plus[mcp]==0.9.0" dlt mcp run
```

To explain each part:
- [uv tool run](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) executes the command in an isolated virtual environment
-`--with PACKAGE_NAME` specifies the Python dependencies for the command that follows
- `dlt-plus[mcp]` ensures to get all the extra dependencies for the MCP server
- `dlt-plus==0.9.0` pins a specific `dlt-plus` version (where the MCP code lives). We suggest at least pinning the `dlt-plus` version to provide a consistent experience
- `dlt mcp run` is a CLI command found in dlt+ that starts the dlt MCP server. Use `dlt mcp run_plus` to

Then, to enable the MCP server and tool usage, several IDEs require you to enable "tool/agent/mcp mode".

### dlt+ MCP server

To run the `dlt+` MCP server, you will need to set your [dlt+ License](../../plus/getting-started/installation#licensing) globally in `~/.dlt/secrets.toml` or in an environment variable (must be set before lauching the IDE) and use `dlt mcp run_plus` in your configuration. If the `dlt+` license is missing, the dlt MCP server will be launched instead. You can tell the two apart by the tools, resources, and prompts availableÂ­.


### Continue

With Continue, you can use [Continue Hub](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/introduction) for a 1-click install of the MCP, or a local config file. Select `Agent Mode` to enable the MCP server.

#### Continue Hub
See the [dltHub page](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub) and select the `dlt` or `dlt+` Assistants. This bundles the MCP with additional Continue-specific features. You can also select the `dlt` or `dlt+` MCP blocks to install the server exclusively.

#### Local
You can define an assistant locally with the same YAML syntax as the Continue Hub by adding files to `$PROJECT_ROOT/.continue/assistants`. This snippet creates an assistant with the MCP only.

```yaml
# local_dlt.yaml
name: dlt MCP  # can change
version: 0.0.1  # can change
schema: v1
mcpServers:
  - name: dlt  # can change
    command: uv
    args:
      - tool
      - run
      - --with
      - dlt-plus[mcp]==0.9.0
      - dlt
      - mcp
      - run
```

There's also a global configuration specs in JSON
```json
{
  "experimental": {
    "modelContextProtocolServers": [
      {
        "transport": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "uv",
          "args": [
            "tool",
            "run",
            "--with",
            "dlt-plus[mcp]==0.9.0",
            "dlt",
            "mcp",
            "run"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

You need to [add a JSON configuration file](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user#2-add-the-filesystem-mcp-server) on your system. See our [full Claude Desktop tutorial](../../plus/features/ai.md)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dlt": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "--with",
        "dlt-plus[mcp]==0.9.0",
        "dlt",
        "mcp",
        "run"
      ]
    } 
  }
}
```


### Cursor

Select **Agent Mode** to enable the MCP server. The [configuration](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers) follows the same JSON specs as Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dlt": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "--with",
        "dlt-plus[mcp]==0.9.0",
        "dlt",
        "mcp",
        "run"
      ]
    } 
  }
}
```

### Cline

Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.cline.bot/mcp-servers/mcp-quickstart) to use the IDE's menu to add MCP servers.

### Manual server launch (advanced)

The following methods allow the user to manually launch the MCP server from their preferred directory and Python environment before connecting to the IDE. The basic installation methods let the IDE launch the server over STDIO in isolation from the current project directory and Python environment.

We won't use `uv tool run` because we want to use the local Python environment instead of an isolated one. We assume that `dlt-plus[mcp]` is installed in the environment, giving access to the `dlt mcp` command.

:::caution
ðŸš§ The MCP, IDE features, and the dlt MCP server are all rapidly evolving and some details are likely to change.
:::

#### SSE transport

To launch the server using [Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse), modify the CLI command to:

```sh
dlt mcp run_plus --sse --port 43655
```

Then, configure your IDE to connect to the local connection at `http://127.0.0.1:43655/sse` (the `/sse` path is important). Many IDEs don't currently support SSE connection, but [Cline does](https://docs.cline.bot/mcp-servers/configuring-mcp-servers#sse-transport). 

#### Proxy mode

Since many IDEs don't currently support SSE, we use a workaround with two MCP servers using the [mcp-proxy](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy) library:

- the **proxy server** is launched by the IDE and communicates with the IDE over STDIO
- the **dlt server** is launched by the user in the desired directory and environment and communicates with the **proxy server** over SSE

The benefit of this approach is that you will never need to update the IDE configuration; it always launches the same proxy server. Then, you can launch the dlt server from any context.

To launch the proxy server, follow the basic installation method (Cursor, Continue, Claude, etc.), but change the command to

```sh
uv tool run mcp-proxy "http://127.0.0.1:43655/sse"
```

For example, Cursor would use this config. 

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dlt": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "mcp-proxy",
        "http://127.0.0.1:43655/sse",
      ]
    } 
  }
}
```

To launch the dlt server, use this command to start communication over SSE. The `--port` value should match the IDE config.

```sh
dlt mcp run_plus --sse --port 43655
```

:::warning
The **proxy server** typically fails at startup if the **dlt server** is not already running. After launching the **dlt server**, use the "reconnect" button in the IDE to have the proxy connect to it.
