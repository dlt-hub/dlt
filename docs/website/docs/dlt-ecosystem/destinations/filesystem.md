# Filesystem & buckets
Filesystem destination stores data in remote file systems and bucket storages like **S3**, **google storage** or **azure blob storage**. Underneath it uses [fsspec](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec) to abstract file operations. Its primary role is to be used as a staging for other destinations but you can also quickly build a [data lake](../../getting-started/build-a-data-platform/build-structured-data-lakehouse.md) with it.

> 💡 Please read the notes on the layout of the data files. Currently we are getting feedback on it. Please join our slack (icon at the top of the page) and help us to find the optimal layout.

## Setup Guide
### 1. Initialize the dlt project

Let's start by initializing a new dlt project as follows:
   ```bash
   dlt init chess filesystem
   ```
   > 💡 This command will initialise your pipeline with chess as the source and the AWS S3 filesystem as the destination.

### 2. Setup bucket storage and credentials

#### AWS S3
The command above creates sample `secrets.toml` and requirements file for AWS S3 bucket. You can install those dependencies by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or with `pip install dlt[s3]` which will install `s3fs` and `boto3` packages.

To edit the `dlt` credentials file with your secret info, open `.dlt/secrets.toml`, which looks like this:
```toml
[destination.filesystem]
bucket_url = "s3://[your_bucket_name]" # replace with your bucket name,

[destination.filesystem.credentials]
aws_access_key_id = "please set me up!" # copy the access key here
aws_secret_access_key = "please set me up!" # copy the secret access key here
```

if you have your credentials stored in `~/.aws/credentials` just remove the **[destination.filesystem.credentials]** section above and `dlt` will fall back to your **default** profile in local credentials. If you want to switch the  profile, pass the profile name as follows (here: `dlt-ci-user`):
```toml
[destination.filesystem.credentials]
aws_profile="dlt-ci-user"
```

You need to create a S3 bucket and a user who can access that bucket. `dlt` is not creating buckets automatically.

1. You can create the S3 bucket in AWS console by clicking on "Create Bucket" in S3 and assigning appropriate name and permissions to the bucket.
2. Once the bucket is created you'll have the bucket URL. For example, If the bucket name is `dlt-ci-test-bucket`, then the bucket URL will be:

   ```
   s3://dlt-ci-test-bucket
   ```

3. To grant permissions to the user being used to access the S3 bucket, go to the IAM > Users, and click on “Add Permissions”.
4. Below you can find a sample policy that gives a minimum permissions required by `dlt` to a bucket we created above. The policy contains permissions to list files in a bucket, get, put and delete objects. **Remember to place your bucket name in Resource section of the policy!**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DltBucketAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAttributes",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::dlt-ci-test-bucket/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::dlt-ci-test-bucket"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
5. To grab the access and secret key for the user. Go to IAM > Users and in the “Security Credentials”, click on “Create Access Key”, and preferably select “Command Line Interface” and create the access key.
6. Grab the “Access Key” and “Secret Access Key” created that are to be used in "secrets.toml".

#### Google Storage
Run `pip install dlt[gs]` which will install `gcfs` package.

To edit the `dlt` credentials file with your secret info, open `.dlt/secrets.toml`. You'll see AWS credentials by default. Use google cloud credentials that you may know from [BigQuery destination](bigquery.md)
```toml
[destination.filesystem]
bucket_url = "gs://[your_bucket_name]" # replace with your bucket name,

[destination.filesystem.credentials]
project_id = "project_id" # please set me up!
private_key = "private_key" # please set me up!
client_email = "client_email" # please set me up!
```

> 💡 Note that you can share the same credentials with BigQuery, just replace the **[destination.filesystem.credentials]** section with less specific one: **[destination.credentials]** which applies to both destinations

if you have default google cloud credentials in your environment (ie. on cloud function) just remove the credentials sections above and `dlt` will fallback to the available default.

Use **Cloud Storage** admin to create a new bucket. Then assign the **Storage Object Admin** role to your service account.

#### Azure Blob Storage
Let us know on our Slack that you need it.

#### Local file system
If for any reason you want to have those files in local folder, setup the `bucket_url` as follows (you are free to use `config.toml` for that as there are no secrets required)

```toml
[destination.filesystem]
bucket_url = "file:///absolute/path"  # three / for absolute path
# bucket_url = "file://relative/path"  # two / for relative path
```

## Write disposition
`filesystem` destination handles the write dispositions as follows:
- `append` - files belonging to such tables are added to dataset folder
- `replace` - all files that belong to such tables are deleted from dataset folder and then current set of files is added.
- `merge` - fallbacks to `append` or to `replace` when no merge nor primary key is defined

## Data loading
All the files are stored in a single folder with the name of the dataset that you passed to the `run` or `load` methods of `pipeline`. In our example chess pipeline it is **chess_players_games_data**.

> 💡 Note that bucket storages are in fact key-blob storage so folder structure is emulated by splitting file names into components by `/`.

The name of each file contains essential metadata on the content:

`<schema_name>.<table_name>.<load_id>.<file_id>.<file_format>` where:
- **schema_name** and **table_name** identify the [schema](../../general-usage/schema.md) and table that define the file structure (column names, data types etc.)
- **load_id** is the [id of the load package](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/visualizations/understanding-the-tables#load-ids) form which the file comes from.
- **file_id** is there are many files with data for a single table, they are copied with different file id.
- **file_format** a format of the file ie. `jsonl` or `parquet`

Please note:
- `dlt` will not dump the current schema content to the bucket
- `dlt` will mark complete loads by creating an empty file that corresponds to `_dlt_loads` table. For example if `chess._dlt_loads.1685299832` file is present in dataset folders, you can be sure that all files for the load package `1685299832` are completely loaded

## Supported file formats
You can choose the following file formats:
* [jsonl](../file-formats/jsonl.md) is used by default
* [parquet](../file-formats/parquet.md) is supported


## Syncing of `dlt` state
This destination does not support restoring the `dlt` state. You can change that by contributing to the core library 😄
You can however easily [backup and restore the pipeline working folder](https://gist.github.com/rudolfix/ee6e16d8671f26ac4b9ffc915ad24b6e) - reusing the bucket and credentials used to store files.
