# Command Line Interface Reference

<!-- this page is fully generated from the argparse object of dlt, run make update-cli-docs to update it -->

This page contains all commands available in the dlt CLI and is generated
automatically from the fully populated python argparse object of dlt.
:::note
Flags and positional commands are inherited from the parent command. Position within the command string
is important. For example if you want to enable debug mode on the pipeline command, you need to add the
debug flag to the base dlt command:

```sh
dlt --debug pipeline
```

Adding the flag after the pipeline keyword will not work.

### `dlt pipeline info`

Displays state of the pipeline, use -v or -vv for more info.

**Usage**
```sh
dlt pipeline [pipeline_name] info [-h]
```

**Description**

Displays the content of the working directory of the pipeline: dataset name, destination, list of
schemas, resources in schemas, list of completed and normalized load packages, and optionally a
pipeline state set by the resources during the extraction process.

**Usage**
```sh
dlt pipeline [pipeline_name] show [-h]
```

**Description**

Generates and launches Streamlit (https://streamlit.io/) app with the loading status and dataset explorer.

This is a simple app that you can use to inspect the schemas and data in the destination as well as your pipeline state and loading status/stats. It should be executed from the same folder from which you ran the pipeline script to access destination credentials.

Requires `streamlit` to be installed in the current environment: `pip install streamlit`.

<details>

<summary>Show Arguments and Options</summary>

Inherits arguments from [`dlt pipeline`](#dlt-pipeline).

**Options**
* `-h, --help` - Show this help message and exit

</details>

### `dlt pipeline failed-jobs`

Displays information on all the failed loads in all completed packages, failed jobs and associated error messages.

**Usage**
```sh
dlt pipeline [pipeline_name] failed-jobs [-h]
```

**Description**

This command scans all the load packages looking for failed jobs and then displays information on

**Usage**
```sh
dlt pipeline [pipeline_name] drop-pending-packages [-h]
```

**Description**

Removes all extracted and normalized packages in the pipeline's working dir.
`dlt` keeps extracted and normalized load packages in the pipeline working directory. When the `run` method is called, it will attempt to normalize and load
pending packages first. The command above removes such packages. Note that **pipeline state** is not reverted to the state at which the deleted packages
were created. Using `dlt pipeline ... sync` is recommended if your destination supports state sync.

<details>

<summary>Show Arguments and Options</summary>

Inherits arguments from [`dlt pipeline`](#dlt-pipeline).

**Options**
* `-h, --help` - Show this help message and exit

</details>

### `dlt pipeline sync`

Drops the local state of the pipeline and resets all the schemas and restores it from destination. The destination state, data and schemas are left intact.

**Usage**
```sh
dlt pipeline [pipeline_name] sync [-h] [--destination DESTINATION]
    [--dataset-name DATASET_NAME]
```

**Description**

This command will remove the pipeline working directory with all pending packages, not synchronized
state changes, and schemas and retrieve the last synchronized data from the destination. If you drop
the dataset the pipeline is loading to, this command results in a complete reset of the pipeline state.

In case of a pipeline without a working directory, the command may be used to create one from the
destination. In order to do that, you need to pass the dataset name and destination name to the CLI
and provide the credentials to connect to the destination (i.e., in `.dlt/secrets.toml`) placed in the
folder where you execute the `pipeline sync` command.

<details>

<summary>Show Arguments and Options</summary>

Inherits arguments from [`dlt pipeline`](#dlt-pipeline).

**Options**
* `-h, --help` - Show this help message and exit
* `--destination DESTINATION` - Sync from this destination when local pipeline state is missing.
* `--dataset-name DATASET_NAME` - Dataset name to sync from when local pipeline state is missing.

</details>

### `dlt pipeline trace`

Displays last run trace, use -v or -vv for more info.

**Usage**
```sh
dlt pipeline [pipeline_name] trace [-h]
```

**Description**

Displays the trace of the last pipeline run containing the start date of the run, elapsed time, and the
same information for all the steps (`extract`, `normalize`, and `load`). If any of the steps failed,
you'll see the message of the exceptions that caused that problem. Successful `load` and `run` steps
will display the load info instead.

<details>

<summary>Show Arguments and Options</summary>

Inherits arguments from [`dlt pipeline`](#dlt-pipeline).

**Options**
* `-h, --help` - Show this help message and exit

</details>

### `dlt pipeline schema`

dlt pipeline [pipeline_name] schema [-h] [--format {json,yaml}]
    [--remove-defaults]
```

**Description**

Displays the default schema for the selected pipeline.

<details>

</details>

### `dlt pipeline drop`

Selectively drop tables and reset state.

**Usage**
```sh
dlt pipeline [pipeline_name] drop [-h] [--destination DESTINATION]
    [--dataset-name DATASET_NAME] [--drop-all] [--state-paths [STATE_PATHS ...]]
    [--schema SCHEMA_NAME] [--state-only] [resources ...]
```

**Description**

Selectively drop tables and reset state.

```sh
dlt pipeline <pipeline name> drop [resource_1] [resource_2]
```

Drops tables generated by selected resources and resets the state associated with them. Mainly used
to force a full refresh on selected tables. In the example below, we drop all tables generated by
the `repo_events` resource in the GitHub pipeline:

```sh
dlt pipeline github_events drop repo_events
```

`dlt` will inform you of the names of dropped tables and the resource state slots that will be
reset:

```text
About to drop the following data in dataset airflow_events_1 in destination dlt.destinations.duckdb:
Selected schema:: github_repo_events
Selected resource(s):: ['repo_events']
Table(s) to drop:: ['issues_event', 'fork_event', 'pull_request_event', 'pull_request_review_event', 'pull_request_review_comment_event', 'watch_event', 'issue_comment_event', 'push_event__payload__commits', 'push_event']
Resource(s) state to reset:: ['repo_events']
Source state path(s) to reset:: []
Do you want to apply these changes? [y/N]
```

As a result of the command above the following will happen:

1. All the indicated tables will be dropped in the destination. Note that `dlt` drops the nested
   tables as well.
2. All the indicated tables will be removed from the indicated schema.
3. The state for the resource `repo_events` was found and will be reset.
4. New schema and state will be stored in the destination.

The `drop` command accepts several advanced settings:

1. You can use regexes to select resources. Prepend the `re:` string to indicate a regex pattern. The example
   below will select all resources starting with `repo`:

```sh
dlt pipeline github_events drop "re:^repo"
```

2. You can drop all tables in the indicated schema:

```sh
dlt pipeline chess drop --drop-all
```

3. You can indicate additional state slots to reset by passing JsonPath to the source state. In the example
   below, we reset the `archives` slot in the source state:

```sh
dlt pipeline chess_pipeline drop --state-paths archives
```

This will select the `archives` key in the `chess` source.

```json
{
  "sources":{
    "chess": {
      "archives": [
        "https://api.chess.com/pub/player/magnuscarlsen/games/2022/05"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**This command is still experimental** and the interface will most probably change.

**Usage**
```sh
dlt pipeline [pipeline_name] load-package [-h] [load-id]
```

**Description**

Shows information on a load package with a given `load_id`. The `load_id` parameter defaults to the
most recent package. Package information includes its state (`COMPLETED/PROCESSED`) and list of all
jobs in a package with their statuses, file sizes, types, and in case of failed jobs—the error
messages from the destination. With the verbose flag set `dlt pipeline -v ...`, you can also see the
list of all tables and columns created at the destination during the loading of that package.

<details>

## `dlt init`

Creates a pipeline project in the current folder by adding existing verified source or creating a new one from template.

**Usage**
```sh
dlt init [-h] [--list-sources] [--location LOCATION] [--branch BRANCH] [--eject]
    [source] [destination]
```

**Description**

The `dlt init` command creates a new dlt pipeline script that loads data from `source` to `destination`. When you run the command, several things happen:

1. Creates a basic project structure if the current folder is empty by adding `.dlt/config.toml`, `.dlt/secrets.toml`, and `.gitignore` files.
2. Checks if the `source` argument matches one of our verified sources and, if so, adds it to your project.
3. If the `source` is unknown, uses a generic template to get you started.
4. Rewrites the pipeline scripts to use your `destination`.
5. Creates sample config and credentials in `secrets.toml` and `config.toml` for the specified source and destination.
6. Creates `requirements.txt` with dependencies required by the source and destination. If one exists, prints instructions on what to add to it.

This command can be used several times in the same folder to add more sources, destinations, and pipelines. It will also update the verified source code to the newest
version if run again with an existing `source` name. You will be warned if files will be overwritten or if the `dlt` version needs an upgrade to run a particular pipeline.

<details>

<summary>Show Arguments and Options</summary>

Inherits arguments from [`dlt`](#dlt).

**Positional arguments**
* `source` - Name of data source for which to create a pipeline. adds existing verified source or creates a new pipeline template if verified source for your data source is not yet implemented.

**Options**
* `-h, --help` - Show this help message and exit
* `--list-sources, -l` - Shows all available verified sources and their short descriptions. for each source, it checks if your local `dlt` version requires an update and prints the relevant warning.
* `--location LOCATION` - Advanced. uses a specific url or local path to verified sources repository.
* `--branch BRANCH` - Advanced. uses specific branch of the verified sources repository to fetch the template.
* `--eject` - Ejects the source code of the core source like sql_database or rest_api so they will be editable by you.
