# What is the simplest way to try dlt?

Our [colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NfSB1DpwbbHX9_t5vlalBTf13utwpMGx?usp=sharing) allows you to see how the pipeline works - It takes some data, and outputs structure tables in db.

The [schema evolution demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H6HKFi-U1V4p0afVucw_Jzv1oiFbH2bu#scrollTo=e4y4sQ78P_OM) presents a similar situation - you can see how new columns and multi-type columns are handled. If you have a slack webhook set, you get a notification too.

The [Github reactions demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BXvma_9R9MX8p_iSvHE4ebg90sUroty2#scrollTo=a3OcZolbaWGf) loads reactions data from a Github repo, loads it to `duckdb` and show a few cool reports using dataframes and SQL. `duckdb/duckdb` repo is analyzed by default.

# What's beyond the colab demos?
* get hands on immediately by following [installation guide](../reference/installation.mdx) and [walkthroughs](../walkthroughs/)
* check out the comprehensive [build a pipeline](build-a-data-pipeline.md) doc to better understand what you can do with dlt
* check out the [build a data warehouse](build-a-data-platform/building-data-warehouse.md) and [build a data lakehouse](build-a-data-platform/build-structured-data-lakehouse.md) section to see how to build a data warehouse or lake with dlt
* check out the [verified sources repository](https://github.com/dlt-hub/verified-sources)  - you can use them for data ingestion, or as reference examples for what you want to build.
