# Release highlights: 1.16

## Smarter timestamp handling

This release brings a major cleanup and unification of how dlt handles timestamps and timezones. Both **tz-aware** and **naive** timestamps are now processed consistently across normalizers and destinations. dlt now also preserves **the exact timestamp type** when using incremental cursors, preventing subtle mismatches during reloads.

It also fixes several tricky edge cases — such as **nanosecond precision** in MSSQL — and ensures that all `time` types behave as documented (always naive, in UTC). Destinations now explicitly declare which timestamp formats they support, so dlt adjusts automatically.

Example:

```py
@dlt.resource(
   name='my_table',
   columns={
      "my_column": {
          "data_type": "timestamp",
          "timezone": True}}
)
def my_resource():
    ...

# Output:
# naive timestamp → UTC tz-aware
# "2024-05-01 12:00:00" → "2024-05-01 12:00:00+00:00"

# tz-aware timestamp with timezone=False → UTC converted, then naive
# "2024-05-01 12:00:00+02:00" → "2024-05-01 10:00:00"
```

The result: predictable, precise timestamp behavior across all sources, transformations, and destinations.
