# Release highlights: 1.22

## Fix: CLI and dashboard now work with `@dlt.destination` custom destinations

**PR: #3676, Issue: #3637**

Previously, `dlt pipeline <name> info` and `dlt pipeline <name> show` crashed with `UnknownDestinationModule` on pipelines using `@dlt.destination`. The dynamically generated destination class stored a module path like `__main__.MySinkDestination` in the pipeline state, which cannot be imported from another process.

**What changed:**

1. **Custom destinations from local scripts** now store `dlt.destinations.destination` as their `destination_type`. This path is always resolvable, so CLI commands and the dashboard work correctly.

2. **Custom destinations from installed packages** store the callable's full importable path, so the callable can be restored and loading works from any process.

3. **The dashboard** correctly handles custom destinations for all three usage patterns: `@dlt.destination` decorator, `destination_callable=func`, and `destination_callable="module.func"`.

**Migration note:**

Pipelines created with earlier versions stored the synthesized class path (e.g. `__main__.MySinkDestination`) as `destination_type` in their state. After upgrading, re-run your pipeline script once to update the stored value. You may see a one time warning that the destination type in state differs from the pipeline. This is harmless and resolves after the next successful run.
