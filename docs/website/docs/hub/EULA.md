# dltHub Software License

Subject to this EULA, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, and non-sublicensable right and license to access, download, install, and use the dltHub Software (the “dltHub Software License”). For the avoidance of doubt, the dltHub Software License does not apply in cases where the OSS License is applicable to the OSS dlt

Nothing in the dltHub Software License allows you to modify, distribute, resell, or sell the dltHub Software unless we specifically indicate otherwise in the Documentation. You may not decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, modify, attempt to disable or circumvent any License File or copy protection in the Software, unless you’re permitted to do so by mandatory law.

You are free to inspect, decompile or view source code if it is distributed with the Software. Consult Documentation for supported methods of accessing the source code.

You are not permitted to distribute any derivative works from the decompiled or disassembled dltHub Software, except if permitted in Specific Terms.

We reserve our rights to limit, condition, and modify the terms and conditions relating to the dltHub Software License at our convenience, upon prior reasonable written notice.

## Specific Terms

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in case of a conflict between the EULA and the specific terms and conditions applicable to the dltHub Software (the “Specific Terms”) the Specific Terms will prevail over the EULA.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the OSS Licenses are separate agreements. If you use OSS, you must agree with the OSS License attached to the OSS and comply with the requirements of the OSS License, including any disclaimers and attribution notices. For the avoidance of doubts, the EULA applies to the extent that it does not contradict the OSS License. The OSS Licenses are considered Specific Terms.

## Specific Terms for the Self-Issued Trial License (“Self-Issued Trial Terms”)
If you select or generate a Self-Issued Trial License, the following Specific Terms apply and supplement the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings in the Agreement.

### No Production Use
Subject to your acceptance of these Terms, dltHub grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the dltHub Software solely for internal evaluation, development, testing and continuous integration in a non-production environment ("Development Mode").

Production Use is not permitted under these Terms. “Production Use” means any use (a) in an environment designated as "production" (b) with live or customer data; (c) in systems that are customer-facing or externally accessible; (c) for revenue-generating or operational workloads;

Any Production Use or other use outside this grant is outside the scope of the license and constitutes copyright infringement and breach of the Agreement. Upon such use, this Self-Issued Trial License terminates automatically and without notice.

### Self-Issuance; Acceptance; Runtime Notices
The Software may provide a command-line or in-product flow that allows you to self-issue a trial license file locally ("License File"). By generating or using a License File, you affirmatively accept these Self-Issued Trial Terms.

The Software may display conspicuous notices (e.g., console messages or headers) indicating Development Mode. You must not remove or suppress such notices.

### Environment Binding; Anonymous Issuance
The Trial License File is bound to your current local development environment using an anonymous, locally-generated identifier (e.g., a random string/UUID created on first run) stored on your machine.

The identifier is not intended to contain personal data.

The Trial License File is not transferable and may not be copied for use on other machines or environments. If your environment changes (e.g., VM migration or rebuild), you must self-issue a new Trial License File.

Where the Self-Issued Trial is obtained without providing contact information (“Anonymous Issuance”), the prior written notice requirement in the Agreement’s “Changes” section does not apply to you.

## Specific Terms for the Trial License (“Trial Terms”)

If you selected Trial License type, the following Specific Terms apply:

* dltHub Software will function until an expiration date encoded in the License File  
* dltHub Software will expire automatically on the expiration date.  
* In the event the License FIle expires, all licensed rights expire.  
* We will not be liable for any Losses, and you will indemnify us from any Losses, resulting from you attempting to use dltHub Software past the expiration date.

We do not restrict the scope of use and number and types of the installations of dltHub Software.

License files contain a unique random identifier known to dltHub and associated with the license subject. Consult your Documentation on how to inspect your license file.

## Specific Terms for the Commercial License (“Commercial Terms”)

If you selected a Commercial License or you were provided such license by your organization additional Specific Terms may apply.

License files contain a unique random identifier known to dltHub and associated with the license subject. Consult your Documentation on how to inspect your license file.

# Maintenance of the dltHub Software

We may decide at all times to discontinue the provision of dltHub Software and this shall not entitle you to exercise any damage claims or other claims.

# Remedies

In addition to any remedies in this EULA, you agree to indemnify and hold us and our Representatives harmless from any third-party claims for Losses resulting from your breach of this EULA.

Your violation of this EULA may cause irreparable harm to us and our Representatives. Therefore, we have the right to seek injunctive relief or other equitable relief if you violate the EULA (meaning we may request a court order to stop you).

# Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree and acknowledge that neither dltHub nor our Representatives have any liability to you whatsoever (a) for indirect, consequential, punitive, special, or consequential damage, including any loss of data, profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings under any circumstances, even if based on negligence; (b) for any other Losses whatsoever that you incur from the use of the dltHub Software, or otherwise in connection with this EULA.

You can terminate the EULA at any time by (a) discontinuing your use of the dltHub Software and (b) uninstalling the dltHub Software.

Unless we agree otherwise with the Customer with whom you are associated, (a) we can terminate this EULA upon written notice to you, (b) we can suspend your right to access and use the dltHub Software if we reasonably suspect that you are in breach of the EULA.

When the EULA is terminated for any reasons, all licenses and rights granted herein, or in any Specific Terms, are hereby terminated, unless specifically mentioned otherwise.

This includes any disclaimers and limitations of liability.

# Governing Laws and Jurisdictions

The laws of Germany will apply to the interpretation of the EULA (without regard to conflict of law rules or principles), and subject to the provisions below, you agree that disputes will exclusively be resolved in the competent courts of Berlin. If you’re entering into this EULA acting as a consumer, the preceding choice of venue of jurisdiction shall not apply. 

# Mandatory Arbitration

Unless you’re located within the European Union, and in any case to the extent permitted under the law applicable in your case, all disputes arising out of or in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the said Rules, using ICC Case Connect, ICC’s digital case management platform connecting parties, arbitral tribunals, and the ICC Secretariat. The arbitration will occur in English, in the location in which you would resolve disputes under the courts of law as above stated. No award or procedural order made in the arbitration shall be published.

## Class Action Waiver

For the avoidance of doubts, the parties waive any right to assert any claims against the other party as a representative or member in any class or representative action, except where such waiver is prohibited by law or deemed by a court of law to be against public policy.

# Changes

Although we might have agreed to restrictions in Commercial Terms, as between you and us, you agree and understand that we can change this EULA from time to time by providing you with a reasonable prior written notice. If you don’t agree with these changes, you must cease to use the dltHub Software.

We can also make changes to the dltHub Software from time to time, with, or without warning. If we believe that these changes can affect your User Software and Products, we will attempt to provide you with a prior written notice prior to making the changes.

If we update this EULA, we will update the “Latest Update” date above to reflect the latest version.

# Interpretation

You may not assign any of your rights under this EULA to anyone else. We may assign this EULA, and any of our rights and obligations hereunder to any other individual or entity at our discretion.

If it turns out that a section of this EULA isn’t enforceable, then that section will be removed or edited as little as required, and the rest of the EULA will still be valid. The headers and sidebar text are provided only to make this EULA easier to read and understand. The fact that we wrote this EULA won’t affect the way the EULA is interpreted. If we don’t immediately take action on a violation of this EULA, we’re not giving up any rights under the Terms, and we may still take action at some point. A waiver on one occasion will not be a waiver of any right or remedy of any future occasion.

You and we agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between us.

The EULA, along with any Specific Terms, make up the entire agreement between us in relation to its subject matter and supersede all prior agreements, representations, and understandings.
