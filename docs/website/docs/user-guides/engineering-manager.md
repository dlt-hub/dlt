# Staff Data Engineer

Staff data engineers create data pipelines, data warehouses and data lakes in order to democratize
access to data in their organizations.

With `dlt` we offer a library and building blocks that data tool builders can use to create modern
data infrastructure for their companies. Staff Data Engineer, Senior Data Engineer, ETL Engineer,
Head of Data Platform - thereâ€™s a variety of titles of how data tool builders are called in
companies.

## What does this role do in an organisation?

The job responsibilities of this senior vary, but often revolve around building and maintaining a
robust data infrastructure:

- Tech: They design and implement scalable data architectures, data pipelines, and data processing
  frameworks.
- Governance: They ensure data integrity, reliability, and security across the data stack. They
  manage data governance, including data quality, data privacy, and regulatory compliance.
- Strategy: Additionally, they evaluate and adopt new technologies, tools, and methodologies to
  improve the efficiency, performance, and scalability of data processes.
- Team skills and staffing: Their responsibilities also involve providing technical leadership,
  mentoring team members, driving innovation, and aligning the data strategy with the organization's
  overall goals.
- Return on investment focus: Ultimately, their focus is on empowering the organization to derive
  actionable insights, make data-driven decisions, and unlock the full potential of their data
  assets.

## Choosing a Data Stack

The above roles play a critical role in choosing the right data stack for their organization. When
selecting a data stack, they need to consider several factors. These include:

- The organization's data requirements.
- Scalability, performance, data governance and security needs.
- Integration capabilities with existing systems and tools.
- Team skill sets, budget, and long-term strategic goals.

They evaluate the pros and cons of various technologies, frameworks, and platforms, considering
factors such as ease of use, community support, vendor reliability, and compatibility with their
specific use cases. The goal is to choose a data stack that aligns with the organization's needs,
enables efficient data processing and analysis, promotes data governance and security, and empowers
teams to deliver valuable insights and solutions.

## What does a senior architect or engineer consider when choosing a tech stack?

- Company Goals and Strategy.
- Cost and Return on Investment (ROI).
- Staffing and Skills.
- Employee Happiness and Productivity.
- Maintainability and Long-term Support.
- Integration with Existing Systems.
- Scalability and Performance.
- Data Security and Compliance.
- Vendor Reliability and Ecosystem.

## What makes dlt a must-have for your data stack or platform?

For starters, `dlt` is the first data pipeline solution that is built for your data team's ROI. Our
vision is to add value, not gatekeep it.

By being a library built to enable free usage, we are uniquely positioned to run in existing stacks
without replacing them. This enables us to disrupt and revolutionise the industry in ways that only
open source communities can.

## dlt massively reduces pipeline maintenance, increases efficiency and ROI

- Reduce engineering effort as much as 5x via a paradigm shift. Structure data automatically to not
  do it manually.
  Read about [structured data lake](https://dlthub.com/docs/blog/next-generation-data-platform), and
  [how to do schema evolution](../reference/explainers/schema-evolution.md).
- Better Collaboration and Communication: Structured data promotes better collaboration and
  communication among team members. Since everyone operates on a shared understanding of the data
  structure, it becomes easier to discuss and align on data-related topics. Queries, reports, and
  analysis can be easily shared and understood by others, enhancing collaboration and teamwork.
- Faster time to build pipelines: After extracting data, if you pass it to `dlt`, you are done. If
  not, it needs to be structured. Because structuring is hard, we curate it. Curation involves at
  least the producer, and consumer, but often also an analyst and the engineer, and is a long,
  friction-ful process.
- Usage focus improves ROI: To use data, we need to understand what it is. Structured data already
  contains a technical description, accelerating usage.
- Lower cost: Reading structured data is cheaper and faster because we can specify which parts of a
  document we want to read.
- Removing friction: By alerting schema changes to the producer and stakeholder, and by automating
  structuring, we can keep the data engineer out of curation and remove the bottleneck.
  [Notify maintenance events.](../running-in-production/running#inspect-save-and-alert-on-schema-changes)
- Improving quality: No more garbage in, garbage out. Because `dlt` structures data and alerts schema
  changes, we can have better governance.

## dlt makes your team happy

- Spend more time using data, less time loading it. When you build a `dlt` pipeline, you only build
  the extraction part, automating the tedious structuring and loading.
- Data meshing to reduce friction: By structuring data before loading, the engineer is no longer
  involved in curation. This makes both the engineer and the others happy.
- Better governance with end to end pipelining via dbt:
  [run dbt packages on the fly](../dlt-ecosystem/transformations/dbt.md),
  [lineage out of the box](../dlt-ecosystem/visualizations/understanding-the-tables).
- Zero learning curve: Declarative loading, simple functional programming. By using `dlt`'s
  declarative, standard approach to loading data, there is no complicated code to maintain, and the
  analysts can thus maintain the code.
- Autonomy and Self service: Customising pipelines is easy, whether you want to plug an anonymiser,
  rename things, or curate what you load.
  [Anonymisers, renamers](../general-usage/customising-pipelines/pseudonymizing_columns.md).
- Easy discovery and governance: By tracking metadata like data lineage, describing data with
  schemas, and alerting changes, we stay on top of the data.
- Simplified access: Querying structured data can be done by anyone with their tools of choice.

## dlt is a library that you can run in unprecedented places

Before `dlt` existed, all loading tools were built either

- as SaaS (5tran, Stitch, etc.);
- as installed apps with their own orchestrator: Pentaho, Talend, Airbyte;
- or as abandonware framework meant to be unrunnable without help (Singer was released without
  orchestration, not for public).

`dlt` is the first python library in this space, which means you can just run it wherever the rest of
your python stuff runs, without adding complexity.

- You can run `dlt` in [Airflow](../dlt-ecosystem/deployments/orchestrators/airflow-deployment.md) -
  this is the first ingestion tool that does this.
- You can run `dlt` in small spaces like [Cloud Functions](../dlt-ecosystem/deployments/running-in-cloud-functions.md)
  or [GitHub Actions](../dlt-ecosystem/deployments/orchestrators/github-actions.md) -
  so you could easily set up webhooks, etc.
- You can run `dlt` in your Jupyter Notebook and load data to [DuckDB](../dlt-ecosystem/destinations/duckdb.md).
- You can run `dlt` on large machines, it will attempt to make the best use of the resources available
  to it.
- You can [run `dlt` locally](../walkthroughs/run-a-pipeline.md) just like you run any python scripts.

The implications:

- Empowering Data Teams and Collaboration: You can discover or prototype in notebooks, run in cloud
  functions, and deploy to production, the same scalable, robust code. No more friction between
  roles.
  [Colab demo.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NfSB1DpwbbHX9_t5vlalBTf13utwpMGx?usp=sharing#scrollTo=A3NRS0y38alk)
- Rapid Data Exploration and Prototyping: By running in Colab with DuckDB, you can explore
  semi-structured data much faster by structuring it with `dlt` and analysing it in SQL.
  [Schema inference](../general-usage/schema#data-normalizer),
  [exploring the loaded data](../dlt-ecosystem/visualizations/understanding-the-tables#show-tables-and-data-in-the-destination).
- No vendor limits: `dlt` is forever free, with no vendor strings. We do not create value by creating
  a pain for you and solving it. We create value by supporting you beyond.
- `dlt` removes complexity: You can use `dlt` in your existing stack, no overheads, no race conditions,
  full observability. Other tools add complexity.
- `dlt` can be leveraged by AI: Because it's a library with low complexity to use, large language
  models can produce `dlt` code for your pipelines.
- Ease of adoption: If you are running python, you can adopt `dlt`. `dlt` is orchestrator and
  destination agnostic.
