# Incremental loading

Incremental loading is the act of loading only new or changed data and not old records that we
already loaded. It enables low-latency and low cost data transfer.

The challenge of incremental pipelines is that if we do not keep track of the state of the load
(i.e. which increments were loaded and which are to be loaded). Read more about state
[here](state.md).

## Choosing a write disposition

### The 3 write dispositions:

- **Full load**: replaces the destination dataset with whatever the source produced on this run. To
achieve this, use `write_disposition='replace'` in your resources. Learn more in the [full loading docs](./full-loading.md)

- **Append**: appends the new data to the destination. Use `write_disposition='append'`.

- **Merge**: Merges new data to the destination using `merge_key` and/or deduplicates/upserts new data
using `primary_key`. Use `write_disposition='merge'`.

### Two simple questions determine the write disposition you use

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![write disposition flowchart](/img/write-dispo-choice.png)

</div>

The "write disposition" you choose depends on the data set and how you can extract it.

To find the "write disposition" you should use, the first question you should ask yourself is "Is my
data stateful or stateless"? Stateful data has a state that is subject to change - for example a
user's profile Stateless data cannot change - for example, a recorded event, such as a page view.

Because stateless data does not need to be updated, we can just append it.

For stateful data, comes a second question - Can I extract it incrementally from the source? If not,
then we need to replace the entire data set. If however we can request the data incrementally such
as "all users added or modified since yesterday" then we can simply apply changes to our existing
dataset with the merge write disposition.

## Merge incremental loading

The `merge` write disposition is used in two scenarios:

1. You want to keep only one instance of certain record i.e. you receive updates of the `user` state
   from an API and want to keep just one record per `user_id`.
1. You receive data in daily batches, and you want to make sure that you always keep just a single
   instance of a record for each batch even in case you load an old batch or load the current batch
   several times a day (i.e. to receive "live" updates).

The `merge` write disposition loads data to a `staging` dataset, deduplicates the staging data if a
`primary_key` is provided, deletes the data from the destination using `merge_key` and `primary_key`,
and then inserts the new records. All of this happens in a single atomic transaction for a parent and all
child tables.

Example below loads all the GitHub events and updates them in the destination using "id" as primary
key, making sure that only a single copy of event is present in `github_repo_events` table:

```python
@dlt.resource(primary_key="id", write_disposition="merge")
def github_repo_events():
    yield from _get_event_pages()
```

You can use compound primary keys:

```python
@dlt.resource(primary_key=("id", "url"), write_disposition="merge")
...
```

Example below merges on a column `batch_day` that holds the day for which given record is valid.
Merge keys also can be compound:

```python
@dlt.resource(merge_key="batch_day", write_disposition="merge")
def get_daily_batch(day):
    yield _get_batch_from_bucket(day)
```

As with any other write disposition you can use it to load data ad hoc. Below we load issues with
top reactions for `duckdb` repo. The lists have, obviously, many overlapping issues, but we want to
keep just one instance of each.

```python
p = dlt.pipeline(destination="bigquery", dataset_name="github")
issues = []
reactions = ["%2B1", "-1", "smile", "tada", "thinking_face", "heart", "rocket", "eyes"]
for reaction in reactions:
    for page_no in range(1, 3):
      page = requests.get(f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/issues?state=all&sort=reactions-{reaction}&per_page=100&page={page_no}", headers=headers)
      print(f"got page for {reaction} page {page_no}, requests left", page.headers["x-ratelimit-remaining"])
      issues.extend(page.json())
p.run(issues, write_disposition="merge", primary_key="id", table_name="issues")
```

Example below dispatches GitHub events to several tables by event type, keeps one copy of each event
by "id" and skips loading of past records using "last value" incremental. As you can see, all of
this we can just declare in our resource.

```python
@dlt.resource(primary_key="id", write_disposition="merge", table_name=lambda i: i['type'])
def github_repo_events(last_created_at = dlt.sources.incremental("created_at", "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z")):
    """A resource taking a stream of github events and dispatching them to tables named by event type. Deduplicates be 'id'. Loads incrementally by 'created_at' """
    yield from _get_rest_pages("events")
```

### Forcing root key propagation

Merge write disposition requires that the `_dlt_id` of top level table is propagated to child
tables. This concept is similar to foreign key which references a parent table, and we call it a
`root key`. Root key is automatically propagated for all tables that have `merge` write disposition
set. We do not enable it everywhere because it takes storage space. Nevertheless, is some cases you
may want to permanently enable root key propagation.

```python
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name='facebook_insights',
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name='facebook_insights_data',
    full_refresh=True
)
fb_ads = facebook_ads_source()
# enable root key propagation on a source that is not a merge one by default.
# this is not required if you always use merge but below we start with replace
fb_ads.root_key = True
# load only disapproved ads
fb_ads.ads.bind(states=("DISAPPROVED", ))
info = pipeline.run(fb_ads.with_resources("ads"), write_disposition="replace")
# merge the paused ads. the disapproved ads stay there!
fb_ads = facebook_ads_source()
fb_ads.ads.bind(states=("PAUSED", ))
info = pipeline.run(fb_ads.with_resources("ads"), write_disposition="merge")
```

In example above we enforce the root key propagation with `fb_ads.root_key = True`. This ensures
that correct data is propagated on initial `replace` load so the future `merge` load can be
executed. You can achieve the same in the decorator `@dlt.source(root_key=True)`.

## Incremental loading with a cursor field

In most of the REST APIs (and other data sources i.e. database tables) you can request new or updated
data by passing a timestamp or id of the "last" record to a query. The API/database returns just the
new/updated records from which you take maximum/minimum timestamp/id for the next load.

To do incremental loading this way, we need to

- figure which field is used to track changes (the so called **cursor field**) (e.g. “inserted_at”, "updated_at”, etc.);
- how to past the "last" (maximum/minimum) value of cursor field to an API to get just new / modified data (how we do this depends on the source API).

Once you've figured that out, `dlt` takes care of finding maximum/minimum cursor field values, removing
duplicates and managing the state with last values of cursor. Take a look at GitHub example below, where we
request recently created issues.

```python
@dlt.resource(primary_key="id")
def repo_issues(
    access_token,
    repository,
    updated_at = dlt.sources.incremental("updated_at", initial_value="1970-01-01T00:00:00Z")
):
    # get issues since "updated_at" stored in state on previous run (or initial_value on first run)
    for page in _get_issues_page(access_token, repository, since=updated_at.start_value):
        yield page
        # last_value is updated after every page
        print(updated_at.last_value)
```

Here we add `updated_at` argument that will receive incremental state, initialized to
`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`. It is configured to track `updated_at` field in issues yielded by
`repo_issues` resource. It will store the newest `updated_at` value in `dlt`
[state](state.md) and make it available in `updated_at.start_value` on next pipeline
run. This value is inserted in `_get_issues_page` function into request query param **since** to [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues?#list-repository-issues)

In essence, `dlt.sources.incremental` instance above
* **updated_at.initial_value** which is always equal to "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z" passed in constructor
* **updated_at.start_value** a maximum `updated_at` value from the previous run or the **initial_value** on first run
* **updated_at.last_value** a "real time" `updated_at` value updated with each yielded item or page. before first yield it equals **start_value**
* **updated_at.end_value** (here not used) [marking end of backfill range](#using-dltsourcesincremental-for-backfill)

When paginating you probably need **start_value** which does not change during the execution of the resource, however
most paginators will return a **next page** link which you should use.

Behind the scenes, `dlt` will deduplicate the results ie. in case the last issue is returned again
(`updated_at` filter is inclusive) and skip already loaded ones.


In the example below we
incrementally load the GitHub events, where API does not let us filter for the newest events - it
always returns all of them. Nevertheless, `dlt` will load only the new items, filtering out all the
duplicates and past issues.
```python
# use naming function in table name to generate separate tables for each event
@dlt.resource(primary_key="id", table_name=lambda i: i['type'])  # type: ignore
def repo_events(
    last_created_at = dlt.sources.incremental("created_at", initial_value="1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", last_value_func=max)
) -> Iterator[TDataItems]:
    repos_path = "/repos/%s/%s/events" % (urllib.parse.quote(owner), urllib.parse.quote(name))
    for page in _get_rest_pages(access_token, repos_path + "?per_page=100"):
        yield page

        # ---> part below is an optional optimization
        # Stop requesting more pages when we encounter an element that
        # is older than the incremental value at the beginning of the run.
        # The start_out_of_range boolean flag is set in this case
        if last_created_at.start_out_of_range:
            break
```

We just yield all the events and `dlt` does the filtering (using `id` column declared as
`primary_key`).
As an optimization we stop requesting more pages once the incremental value is out of range,
in this case that means we got an element which has a smaller `created_at` than the the `last_created_at.start_value`.
The `start_out_of_range` boolean flag is set when the first such element is yielded from the resource, and
since we know that github returns results ordered from newest to oldest, we know that all subsequent
items will be filtered out anyway and there's no need to fetch more data.

### max, min or custom `last_value_func`

`dlt.sources.incremental` allows to choose a function that orders (compares) values coming from the items to current `last_value`.
* The default function is built-in `max` which returns bigger value of the two
* Another built-in `min` returns smaller value.

You can pass your custom function as well. This lets you define
`last_value` on complex types i.e. dictionaries and store indexes of last values, not just simple
types. The `last_value` argument is a [JSON Path](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath#operators)
and lets you select nested and complex data (including the whole data item when `$` is used).
Example below creates last value which is a dictionary holding a max `created_at` value for each
created table name:

```python
def by_event_type(event):
    last_value = None
    if len(event) == 1:
        item, = event
    else:
        item, last_value = event

    if last_value is None:
        last_value = {}
    else:
        last_value = dict(last_value)
    item_type = item["type"]
    last_value[item_type] = max(item["created_at"], last_value.get(item_type, "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"))
    return last_value

@dlt.resource(primary_key="id", table_name=lambda i: i['type'])
def get_events(last_created_at = dlt.sources.incremental("$", last_value_func=by_event_type)):
    with open("tests/normalize/cases/github.events.load_page_1_duck.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        yield json.load(f)
```

### Deduplication primary_key

`dlt.sources.incremental` let's you optionally set a `primary_key` that is used exclusively to
deduplicate and which does not become a table hint. The same setting lets you disable the
deduplication altogether when empty tuple is passed. Below we pass `primary_key` directly to
`incremental` to disable deduplication. That overrides `delta` primary_key set in the resource:

```python
@dlt.resource(primary_key="delta")
# disable the unique value check by passing () as primary key to incremental
def some_data(last_timestamp=dlt.sources.incremental("item.ts", primary_key=())):
    for i in range(-10, 10):
        yield {"delta": i, "item": {"ts": pendulum.now().timestamp()}}
```

### Using `dlt.sources.incremental` with dynamically created resources

When resources are [created dynamically](source.md#create-resources-dynamically) it is possible to
use `dlt.sources.incremental` definition as well.

```python
@dlt.source
def stripe():
    # declare a generator function
    def get_resource(
        endpoint: Endpoints,
        created: dlt.sources.incremental=dlt.sources.incremental("created")
    ):
        ...
        yield data

    # create resources for several endpoints on a single decorator function
    for endpoint in Endpoints:
        yield dlt.resource(
            get_resource,
            name=endpoint.value,
            write_disposition="merge",
            primary_key="id"
        )(endpoint)
```

Please note that in the example above, `get_resource` is passed as a function to `dlt.resource` to
which we bind the endpoint: **dlt.resource(...)(endpoint)**.

:::caution
The typical mistake is to pass a generator (not a function) as below:

`yield dlt.resource(get_resource(endpoint), name=endpoint.value, write_disposition="merge", primary_key="id")`.

Here we call **get_resource(endpoint)** and that creates un-evaluated generator on which resource
is created. That prevents `dlt` from controlling the **created** argument during runtime and will
result in `IncrementalUnboundError` exception.
:::

### Using `dlt.sources.incremental` for backfill
You can specify both initial and end dates when defining incremental loading. Let's go back to our Github example:
```python
@dlt.resource(primary_key="id")
def repo_issues(
    access_token,
    repository,
    created_at = dlt.sources.incremental("created_at", initial_value="1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", end_value="2022-07-01T00:00:00Z")
):
    # get issues from created from last "created_at" value
    for page in _get_issues_page(access_token, repository, since=created_at.start_value, until=created_at.end_value):
        yield page
```
Above we use `initial_value` and `end_value` arguments of the `incremental` to define the range of issues that we want to retrieve
and pass this range to the Github API (`since` and `until`). As in the examples above, `dlt` will make sure that only the issues from
defined range are returned.

Please note that when `end_date` is specified, `dlt` **will not modify the existing incremental state**. The backfill is **stateless** and:
1. You can run backfill and incremental load in parallel (ie. in Airflow DAG) in a single pipeline.
2. You can partition your backfill into several smaller chunks and run them in parallel as well.

To define specific ranges to load, you can simply override the incremental argument in the resource, for example:

```python
july_issues = repo_issues(
    created_at=dlt.sources.incremental(
        initial_value='2022-07-01T00:00:00Z', end_value='2022-08-01T00:00:00Z'
    )
)
august_issues = repo_issues(
    created_at=dlt.sources.incremental(
        initial_value='2022-08-01T00:00:00Z', end_value='2022-09-01T00:00:00Z'
    )
)
...
```

Note that `dlt`'s incremental filtering considers the ranges half closed. `initial_value` is inclusive, `end_value` is exclusive, so chaining ranges like above works without overlaps.

### Using Airflow schedule for backfill and incremental loading
When [running in Airflow task](../walkthroughs/deploy-a-pipeline/deploy-with-airflow-composer.md#2-modify-dag-file), you can opt-in your resource to get the `initial_value`/`start_value` and `end_value` from Airflow schedule associated with your DAG. Let's assume that **Zendesk tickets** resource contains a year of data with thousands of tickets. We want to backfill the last year of data week by week and then continue incremental loading daily.
```python
@dlt.resource(primary_key="id")
def tickets(
    zendesk_client,
    updated_at=dlt.sources.incremental[int](
        "updated_at",
        allow_external_schedulers=True
    ),
):
    for page in zendesk_client.get_pages(
        "/api/v2/incremental/tickets", "tickets", start_time=updated_at.start_value
    ):
        yield page
```
We opt-in to Airflow scheduler by setting `allow_external_schedulers` to `True`:
1. When running on Airflow, the start and end values are controlled by Airflow and `dlt` [state](state.md) is not used.
2. In all other environments, the `incremental` behaves as usual, maintaining `dlt` state.

Let's generate a deployment with `dlt deploy zendesk_pipeline.py airflow-composer` and customize the dag:
```python
@dag(
    schedule_interval='@weekly',
    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2023, 2, 1),
    end_date=pendulum.datetime(2023, 8, 1),
    catchup=True,
    max_active_runs=1,
    default_args=default_task_args
)
def zendesk_backfill_bigquery():
    tasks = PipelineTasksGroup("zendesk_support_backfill", use_data_folder=False, wipe_local_data=True)

    # import zendesk like in the demo script
    from zendesk import zendesk_support

    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name="zendesk_support_backfill",
        dataset_name="zendesk_support_data",
        destination='bigquery',
    )
    # select only incremental endpoints in support api
    data = zendesk_support().with_resources("tickets", "ticket_events", "ticket_metric_events")
    # create the source, the "serialize" decompose option will converts dlt resources into Airflow tasks. use "none" to disable it
    tasks.add_run(pipeline, data, decompose="serialize", trigger_rule="all_done", retries=0, provide_context=True)


zendesk_backfill_bigquery()
```
What got customized:
1. We use weekly schedule, and want to get the data from February 2023 (`start_date`) until end of July ('end_date').
2. We make Airflow to generate all weekly runs (`catchup` is True).
2. We create `zendesk_support` resources where we select only the incremental resources we want to backfill.

When you enable the DAG in Airflow, it will generate several runs and start executing them, starting in February and ending in August. Your resource will receive
subsequent weekly intervals starting with `2023-02-12, 00:00:00 UTC` to `2023-02-19, 00:00:00 UTC`.

You can repurpose the DAG above to start loading new data incrementally after (or during) the backfill:
```python
@dag(
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2023, 2, 1),
    catchup=False,
    max_active_runs=1,
    default_args=default_task_args
)
def zendesk_new_bigquery():
    tasks = PipelineTasksGroup("zendesk_support_new", use_data_folder=False, wipe_local_data=True)

    # import your source from pipeline script
    from zendesk import zendesk_support

    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name="zendesk_support_new",
        dataset_name="zendesk_support_data",
        destination='bigquery',
    )
    tasks.add_run(pipeline, zendesk_support(), decompose="serialize", trigger_rule="all_done", retries=0, provide_context=True)
```
Above, we switch to daily schedule and disable catchup and end date. We also load all the support resources to the same dataset as backfill (`zendesk_support_data`).
If you want to run this DAG parallel with the backfill DAG, change the pipeline name ie. to `zendesk_support_new` as above.

**Under the hood**
Before `dlt` starts executing incremental resources, it looks for `data_interval_start` and `data_interval_end` Airflow task context variables. Those got mapped to `initial_value` and `end_value` of the
`Incremental` class:
1. `dlt` is smart enough to convert Airflow datetime to iso strings or unix timestamps if your resource is using them. In our example we instantiate `updated_at=dlt.sources.incremental[int]`, where we declare the last value type to be **int**. `dlt` can also infer type if you provide `initial_value` argument.
2. If `data_interval_end` is in the future or is None, `dlt` sets the `end_value` to **now**.
3. If  `data_interval_start` == `data_interval_end` we have a manually triggered DAG run. In that case `data_interval_end` will also be set to **now**.

**Manual runs**
You can run DAGs manually but you must remember to specify the Airflow logical date of the run in the past (use Run with config option). For such run `dlt` will load all data from that past date until now.
If you do not specify the past date, a run with a range (now, now) will happen yielding no data.

### Using `start/end_out_of_range` flags with incremental resources

The `dlt.sources.incremental` instance provides `start_out_of_range` and `end_out_of_range`
attributes which are set when the resource yields an element with a higher/lower cursor value than the
initial or end values.
This makes it convenient to optimize resources in some cases.

* `start_out_of_range` is `True` when the resource yields any item with a _lower_ cursor value than the `initial_value`
* `end_out_of_range` is `True` when the resource yields any item with an equal or _higher_ cursor value than the `end_value`

**Note**: "higher" and "lower" here refers to when the default `last_value_func` is used (`max()`),
when using `min()` "higher" and "lower" are inverted.

You can use these flags when both:

1. The source does **not** offer start/end filtering of results (e.g. there is no `start_time/end_time` query parameter or similar)
2. The source returns results **ordered by the cursor field**

:::caution
If you use those flags, **make sure that the data source returns record ordered** (ascending / descending) on the cursor field,
e.g. if an API returns results both higher and lower
than the given `end_value` in no particular order, the `end_out_of_range` flag can be `True` but you'll still want to keep loading.
:::

The github events example above demonstrates how to use `start_out_of_range` as a stop condition.
This approach works in any case where the API returns items in descending order and we're incrementally loading newer data.

In the same fashion the `end_out_of_range` filter can be used to optimize backfill so we don't continue
making unnecessary API requests after the end of range is reached. For example:

```python
@dlt.resource(primary_key="id")
def tickets(
    zendesk_client,
    updated_at=dlt.sources.incremental(
        "updated_at",
        initial_value="2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        end_value="2023-02-01T00:00:00Z",
    ),
):
    for page in zendesk_client.get_pages(
        "/api/v2/incremental/tickets", "tickets", start_time=updated_at.start_value
    ):
        yield page

        # Optimization: Stop loading when we reach the end value
        if updated_at.end_out_of_range:
            return
```

In this example we're loading tickets from Zendesk. The Zendesk API yields items paginated and ordered by oldest to newest,
but only offers a `start_time` parameter for filtering. The incremental `end_out_of_range` flag is set on the first item which
has a timestamp equal or higher than `end_value`. All subsequent items get filtered out so there's no need to request more data.

## Doing a full refresh

You may force a full refresh of a `merge` and `append` pipelines:

1. In case of a `merge` the data in the destination is deleted and loaded fresh. Currently we do not
   deduplicate data during the full refresh.
1. In case of `dlt.sources.incremental` the data is deleted and loaded from scratch. The state of
   the incremental is reset to the initial value.

Example:

```python
p = dlt.pipeline(destination="bigquery", dataset_name="dataset_name")
# do a full refresh
p.run(merge_source(), write_disposition="replace")
# do a full refresh of just one table
p.run(merge_source().with_resources("merge_table"), write_disposition="replace")
# run a normal merge
p.run(merge_source())
```

Passing write disposition to `replace` will change write disposition on all the resources in
`repo_events` during the run of the pipeline.

## Custom incremental loading with pipeline state

The pipeline state is a Python dictionary which gets committed atomically with the data; you can set
values in it in your resources and on next pipeline run, request them back.

The pipeline state is in principle scoped to the resource - all values of the state set by resource
are private and isolated from any other resource. You can also access the source-scoped state which
can be shared across resources.
[You can find more information on pipeline state here](state.md#pipeline-state).

### Preserving the last value in resource state.

For the purpose of preserving the “last value” or similar loading checkpoints, we can open a dlt
state dictionary with a key and a default value as below. When the resource is executed and the data
is loaded, the yielded resource data will be loaded at the same time with the update to the state.

In the two examples below you see how the `dlt.sources.incremental` is working under the hood.

```python
@resource()
def tweets():
    # Get a last value from loaded metadata. If not exist, get None
    last_val = dlt.current.resource_state().setdefault("last_updated", None)
    # get data and yield it
    data = get_data(start_from=last_val)
    yield data
    # change the state to the new value
    dlt.current.state()["last_updated"]  = data["last_timestamp"]
```

If we keep a list or a dictionary in the state, we can modify the underlying values in the objects,
and thus we do not need to set the state back explicitly.

```python
@resource()
def tweets():
    # Get a last value from loaded metadata. If not exist, get None
    loaded_dates = dlt.current.resource_state().setdefault("days_loaded", [])
    # do stuff: get data and add new values to the list
    # `loaded_date` is a reference to the `dlt.current.resource_state()["days_loaded"]` list
    # and thus modifying it modifies the state
    yield data
    loaded_dates.append('2023-01-01')
```

Step by step explanation of how to get or set the state:

1. We can use the function `var = dlt.current.resource_state().setdefault("key", [])`. This allows
   us to retrieve the values of `key`. If `key` was not set yet, we will get the default value `[]`
   instead.
1. We now can treat `var` as a python list - We can append new values to it, or if applicable we can
   read the values from previous loads.
1. On pipeline run, the data will load, and the new `var`'s value will get saved in the state. The
   state is stored at the destination, so it will be available on subsequent runs.

### Advanced state usage: storing a list of processed entities

Let’s look at the `player_games` resource from the chess pipeline. The chess API has a method to
request games archives for a given month. The task is to prevent the user to load the same month
data twice - even if the user makes a mistake and requests the same months range again:

- Our data is requested in 2 steps:
  - Get all available archives URLs.
  - Get the data from each URL.
- We will add the “chess archives” URLs to this list we created.
- This will allow us to track what data we have loaded.
- When the data is loaded, the list of archives is loaded with it.
- Later we can read this list and know what data has already been loaded.

In the following example, we initialize a variable with an empty list as a default:

```python
@dlt.resource(write_disposition="append")
def players_games(chess_url, players, start_month=None, end_month=None):
    loaded_archives_cache = dlt.current.resource_state().setdefault("archives", [])

    # as far as python is concerned, this variable behaves like
    # loaded_archives_cache = state['archives'] or []
    # afterwards we can modify list, and finally
    # when the data is loaded, the cache is updated with our loaded_archives_cache

    # get archives for a given player
    archives = get_players_archives(chess_url, players)
    for url in archives:
        # if not in cache, yield the data and cache the URL
        if url not in loaded_archives_cache:
            # add URL to cache and yield the associated data
            loaded_archives_cache.append(url)
            r = requests.get(url)
            r.raise_for_status()
            yield r.json().get("games", [])
        else:
            print(f"skipping archive {url}")
```

### Advanced state usage: tracking the last value for all search terms in Twitter API

```python
@dlt.resource(write_disposition="append")
def search_tweets(twitter_bearer_token=dlt.secrets.value, search_terms=None, start_time=None, end_time=None, last_value=None):
    headers = _headers(twitter_bearer_token)
    for search_term in search_terms:
        # make cache for each term
        last_value_cache = dlt.current.state().setdefault(f"last_value_{search_term}", None)
        print(f'last_value_cache: {last_value_cache}')
        params = {...}
        url = "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent"
        response = _paginated_get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
        for page in response:
            page['search_term'] = search_term
            last_id = page.get('meta', {}).get('newest_id', 0)
            #set it back - not needed if we
            dlt.current.state()[f"last_value_{search_term}"] = max(last_value_cache or 0, int(last_id))
            # print the value for each search term
            print(f'new_last_value_cache for term {search_term}: {last_value_cache}')

            yield page
```
