`dlt` pipelines usually require configurations and credentials. These can be set up in [various ways](setup):

1. Environment variables
2. Configuration files (`secrets.toml` and `config.toml`)
3. Key managers and Vaults

`dlt` automatically extracts configuration settings and secrets based on flexible [naming conventions](setup/#naming-convention). It then [injects](advanced/#injection-mechanism) these values where needed in code.
