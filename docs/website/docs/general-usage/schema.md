# Schema

The schema describes the structure of normalized data (e.g., tables, columns, data types, etc.) and
provides instructions on how the data should be processed and loaded. dlt generates schemas from
the data during the normalization process. Users can affect this standard behavior by providing
**hints** that change how tables, columns, and other metadata are generated and how the data is
loaded. Such hints can be passed in the code, i.e., to the `dlt.resource` decorator or `pipeline.run`
method. Schemas can also be exported and imported as files, which can be directly modified.

> ðŸ’¡ `dlt` associates a schema with a [source](source.md) and a table schema with a
> [resource](resource.md).

## Schema content hash and version

Each schema file contains a content-based hash `version_hash` that is used to:

1. Detect manual changes to the schema (i.e., user edits content).
1. Detect if the destination database schema is synchronized with the file schema.

Each time the schema is saved, the version hash is updated.

Each schema contains a numeric version which increases automatically whenever the schema is updated and
saved. The numeric version is meant to be human-readable. There are cases (parallel processing) where
the order is lost.

> ðŸ’¡ The schema in the destination is migrated if its hash is not stored in the `_dlt_versions` table. In
> principle, many pipelines may send data to a single dataset. If table names clash, then a single
> table with the union of the columns will be created. If columns clash, and they have different
> types, etc., then the load may fail if the data cannot be coerced.

## Naming convention

`dlt` creates tables, nested tables, and column schemas from the data. The data being loaded,
typically JSON documents, contains identifiers (i.e., key names in a dictionary) with any Unicode
characters, any lengths, and naming styles. On the other hand, the destinations accept very strict
namespaces for their identifiers. Like Redshift, that accepts case-insensitive alphanumeric
identifiers with a maximum of 127 characters.

Each schema contains a [naming convention](naming-convention.md) that tells dlt how to translate identifiers to the
namespace that the destination understands. This convention can be configured, changed in code, or enforced via
destination.

The default naming convention:

1. Converts identifiers to snake_case, small caps. Removes all ASCII characters except ASCII
   alphanumerics and underscores.
1. Adds `_` if the name starts with a number.
1. Multiples of `_` are converted into a single `_`.
1. Nesting is expressed as double `_` in names.
1. It shortens the identifier if it exceeds the length at the destination.

> ðŸ’¡ The standard behavior of `dlt` is to **use the same naming convention for all destinations** so
> users always see the same tables and columns in their databases.

> ðŸ’¡ If you provide any schema elements that contain identifiers via decorators or arguments (i.e.,
> `table_name` or `columns`), all the names used will be converted via the naming convention when
> adding to the schema. For example, if you execute `dlt.run(... table_name="CamelCase")` the data
> will be loaded into `camel_case`.

> ðŸ’¡ Use simple, short, small caps identifiers for everything!

To retain the original naming convention (like keeping `"createdAt"` as it is instead of converting it to `"created_at"`), you can use the direct naming convention in "config.toml" as follows:
```toml
[schema]
naming="direct"
```
:::caution
Opting for `"direct"` naming bypasses most name normalization processes. This means any unusual characters present will be carried over unchanged to database tables and columns. Please be aware of this behavior to avoid potential issues.
:::

The naming convention is configurable, and users can easily create their own
conventions that, i.e., pass all the identifiers unchanged if the destination accepts that (i.e.,
DuckDB).

## Data normalizer

The data normalizer changes the structure of the input data so it can be loaded into the destination. The standard `dlt` normalizer creates a relational structure from Python dictionaries and lists. Elements of that structure, such as table and column definitions, are added to the schema.

The data normalizer is configurable, and users can plug in their own normalizers, for example, to handle nested table linking differently or generate parquet-like data structures instead of nested tables.

## Tables and columns

The key components of a schema are tables and columns. You can find a dictionary of tables in the `tables` key or via the `tables` property of the Schema object.

A table schema has the following properties:

1. `name` and `description`.
2. `columns` with a dictionary of table schemas.
3. `write_disposition` hint telling `dlt` how new data coming to the table is loaded.
4. `schema_contract` - describes a [contract on the table](schema-contracts.md).
5. `parent` is a part of the nested reference, defined on a nested table and points to the parent table.

The table schema is extended by the data normalizer. The standard data normalizer adds propagated columns to it.

A column schema contains the following properties:

1. `name` and `description` of a column in a table.

Data type information:

1. `data_type` with a column data type.
2. `precision` is a precision for **text**, **timestamp**, **time**, **bigint**, **binary**, and **decimal** types.
3. `scale` is a scale for the **decimal** type.
4. `timezone` is a flag indicating TZ aware or NTZ **timestamp** and **time**. The default value is **true**.
5. `nullable` tells if the column is nullable or not.
6. `is_variant` indicates that the column was generated as a variant of another column.

A column schema contains the following basic hints:

1. `primary_key` marks a column as part of the primary key.
2. `unique` indicates that the column is unique. On some destinations, this generates a unique index.
3. `merge_key` marks a column as part of the merge key used by [incremental load](./incremental-loading.md#merge-incremental_loading).

Hints below are used to create [nested references](#root-and-nested-tables-nested-references):
1. `row_key` is a special form of primary key created by `dlt` to uniquely identify rows of data.
2. `parent_key` is a special form of foreign key used by nested tables to refer to parent tables.
3. `root_key` marks a column as part of the root key, which is a type of foreign key always referring to the root table.
4. `_dlt_list_idx` is an index on a nested list from which a nested table is created.

`dlt` lets you define additional performance hints:

1. `partition` marks a column to be used to partition data.
2. `cluster` marks a column to be used to cluster data.
3. `sort` marks a column as sortable/having order. On some destinations, this non-unique generates an index.

:::note
Each destination can interpret the hints in its own way. For example, the `cluster` hint is used by Redshift to define table distribution and by BigQuery to specify a cluster column. DuckDB and Postgres ignore it when creating tables.
:::

### Variant columns

Variant columns are generated by a normalizer when it encounters a data item with a type that cannot be coerced into an existing column. Please see our [`coerce_row`](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt/blob/7d9baf1b8fdf2813bcf7f1afe5bb3558993305ca/dlt/common/schema/schema.py#L205) if you are interested in seeing how it works internally.

Let's consider our [getting started](../intro) example with a slightly different approach, where `id` is an integer type at the beginning:

```py
data = [
  {"id": 1, "human_name": "Alice"}
]
```

Once the pipeline runs, we will have the following schema:

| name          | data_type     | nullable |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| id            | bigint        | true     |
| human_name    | text          | true     |

Now imagine the data has changed and the `id` field also contains strings:

```py
data = [
  {"id": 1, "human_name": "Alice"},
  {"id": "idx-nr-456", "human_name": "Bob"}
]
```

So after you run the pipeline, `dlt` will automatically infer type changes and will add a new field in the schema `id__v_text` to reflect that new data type for `id`. For any type that is not compatible with integer, it will create a new field.

| name          | data_type     | nullable |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| id            | bigint        | true     |
| human_name    | text          | true     |
| id__v_text    | text          | true     |

On the other hand, if the `id` field was already a string, then introducing new data with `id` containing other types will not change the schema because they can be coerced to string.

Now go ahead and try to add a new record where `id` is a float number; you should see a new field `id__v_double` in the schema.

### Data types

| dlt Data Type | Source Value Example                                | Precision and Scale                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| text          | `'hello world'`                                     | Supports precision, typically mapping to **VARCHAR(N)** |
| double        | `45.678`                                            |                                                         |
| bool          | `True`                                              |                                                         |
| timestamp     | `'2023-07-26T14:45:00Z'`, `datetime.datetime.now()` | Supports precision expressed as parts of a second       |
| date          | `datetime.date(2023, 7, 26)`                        |                                                         |
| time          | `'14:01:02'`, `datetime.time(14, 1, 2)`             | Supports precision - see **timestamp**                  |
| bigint        | `9876543210`                                        | Supports precision as number of bits                    |
| binary        | `b'\x00\x01\x02\x03'`                               | Supports precision, like **text**                       |
| json          | `[4, 5, 6]`, `{'a': 1}`                             |                                                         |
| decimal       | `Decimal('4.56')`                                   | Supports precision and scale                            |
| wei           | `2**56`                                             |                                                         |

`wei` is a datatype that tries to best represent native Ethereum 256-bit integers and fixed-point decimals. It works correctly on Postgres and BigQuery. All other destinations have insufficient precision.

`json` data type tells `dlt` to load that element as JSON or string and not attempt to flatten or create a nested table out of it. Note that structured types like arrays or maps are not supported by `dlt` at this point.

`time` data type is saved in the destination without timezone info; if timezone is included, it is stripped. E.g., `'14:01:02+02:00` -> `'14:01:02'`.

:::tip
The precision and scale are interpreted by the particular destination and are validated when a column is created. Destinations that do not support precision for a given data type will ignore it.

The precision for **timestamp** is useful when creating **parquet** files. Use 3 for milliseconds, 6 for microseconds, and 9 for nanoseconds.

The precision for **bigint** is mapped to available integer types, i.e., TINYINT, INT, BIGINT. The default is 64 bits (8 bytes) precision (BIGINT).
:::

## Table references
`dlt` tables refer to other tables. It supports two types of such references:
1. **Nested reference** created automatically when nested data (i.e., a `json` document containing a nested list) is converted into relational form. These references use specialized column and table hints and are used, for example, when [merging data](incremental-loading.md).
2. **Table references** are optional, user-defined annotations that are not verified and enforced but may be used by downstream tools, for example, to generate automatic tests or models for the loaded data.

### Nested references: root and nested tables
When `dlt` normalizes nested data into a relational schema, it automatically creates [**root** and **nested** tables](destination-tables.md) and links them using **nested references**.

1. All tables receive a column with the `row_key` hint (named `_dlt_id` by default) to uniquely identify each row of data.
2. Nested tables receive a `parent` table hint with the name of the parent table. The root table does not have a `parent` hint defined.
3. Nested tables receive a column with the `parent_key` hint (named `_dlt_parent_id` by default) that refers to the `row_key` of the `parent` table.

`parent` + `row_key` + `parent_key` form a **nested reference**: from the nested table to the `parent` table and are extensively used when loading data. Both `replace` and `merge` write dispositions.

`row_key` is created as follows:
1. A random string on **root** tables, except for [`upsert`](incremental-loading.md#upsert-strategy) and
[`scd2`](incremental-loading.md#scd2-strategy) merge strategies, where it is a deterministic hash of the `primary_key` (or whole row, so-called `content_hash`, if PK is not defined).
2. A deterministic hash of `parent_key`, `parent` table name, and position in the list (`_dlt_list_idx`)
for **nested** tables.

You are able to bring your own `row_key` by adding a `_dlt_id` column/field to your data (both root and nested). All data types with an equal operator are supported.

`merge` write disposition requires an additional nested reference that goes from **nested** to **root** table, skipping all parent tables in between. This reference is created by [adding a column with a hint](incremental-loading.md#forcing-root-key-propagation) `root_key` (named `_dlt_root_id` by default) to nested tables.

### Table references
You can annotate tables with table references. This feature is coming soon.

## Schema settings

The `settings` section of the schema file lets you define various global rules that impact how tables
and columns are inferred from data. For example, you can assign a **primary_key** hint to all columns named `id` or force a **timestamp** data type on all columns containing `timestamp` with the use of a regex pattern.

### Data type autodetectors

You can define a set of functions that will be used to infer the data type of a column from a
value. The functions are run from top to bottom on the lists. Look in `detections.py` to see what is
available. The **iso_timestamp** detector that looks for ISO 8601 strings and converts them to **timestamp**
is enabled by default.

```yaml
settings:
  detections:
    - timestamp
    - iso_timestamp
    - iso_date
    - large_integer
    - hexbytes_to_text
    - wei_to_double
```

Alternatively, you can add and remove detections from code:
```py
  source = data_source()
  # remove iso time detector
  source.schema.remove_type_detection("iso_timestamp")
  # convert UNIX timestamp (float, within a year from NOW) into timestamp
  source.schema.add_type_detection("timestamp")
```
Above, we modify a schema that comes with a source to detect UNIX timestamps with the **timestamp** detector.

### Column hint rules

You can define global rules that will apply hints to newly inferred columns. These rules apply to normalized column names. You can use column names directly or with regular expressions. `dlt` matches the column names **after they have been normalized with naming conventions**.

By default, the schema adopts hint rules from the json(relational) normalizer to support correct hinting of columns added by the normalizer:

```yaml
settings:
  default_hints:
    row_key:
      - _dlt_id
    parent_key:
      - _dlt_parent_id
    not_null:
      - _dlt_id
      - _dlt_root_id
      - _dlt_parent_id
      - _dlt_list_idx
      - _dlt_load_id
    unique:
      - _dlt_id
    root_key:
      - _dlt_root_id
```
Above, we require an exact column name match for a hint to apply. You can also use a regular expression (which we call `SimpleRegex`) as follows:
```yaml
settings:
    partition:
      - re:_timestamp$
```
Above, we add a `partition` hint to all columns ending with `_timestamp`. You can do the same thing in the code:
```py
  source = data_source()
  # this will update existing hints with the hints passed
  source.schema.merge_hints({"partition": ["re:_timestamp$"]})
```

### Preferred data types

You can define rules that will set the data type for newly created columns. Put the rules under the `preferred_types` key of `settings`. On the left side, there's a rule on a column name; on the right side is the data type. You can use column names directly or with regular expressions. `dlt` matches the column names **after they have been normalized with naming conventions**.

Example:

```yaml
settings:
  preferred_types:
    re:timestamp: timestamp
    inserted_at: timestamp
    created_at: timestamp
    updated_at: timestamp
```

Above, we prefer the `timestamp` data type for all columns containing the **timestamp** substring and define a few exact matches, i.e., **created_at**.
Here's the same thing in code:
```py
  source = data_source()
  source.schema.update_preferred_types(
    {
      "re:timestamp": "timestamp",
      "inserted_at": "timestamp",
      "created_at": "timestamp",
      "updated_at": "timestamp",
    }
  )
```
### Applying data types directly with `@dlt.resource` and `apply_hints`
`dlt` offers the flexibility to directly apply data types and hints in your code, bypassing the need for importing and adjusting schemas. This approach is ideal for rapid prototyping and handling data sources with dynamic schema requirements.

### Direct specification in `@dlt.resource`
Directly define data types and their properties, such as nullability, within the `@dlt.resource` decorator. This eliminates the dependency on external schema files. For example:

```py
@dlt.resource(name='my_table', columns={"my_column": {"data_type": "bool", "nullable": True}})
def my_resource():
    for i in range(10):
        yield {'my_column': i % 2 == 0}
```
This code snippet sets up a nullable boolean column named `my_column` directly in the decorator.

#### Using `apply_hints`
When dealing with dynamically generated resources or needing to programmatically set hints, `apply_hints` is your tool. It's especially useful for applying hints across various collections or tables at once.

For example, to apply a `json` data type across all collections from a MongoDB source:

```py
all_collections = ["collection1", "collection2", "collection3"]  # replace with your actual collection names
source_data = mongodb().with_resources(*all_collections)

for col in all_collections:
    source_data.resources[col].apply_hints(columns={"column_name": {"data_type": "json"}})

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="mongodb_pipeline",
    destination="duckdb",
    dataset_name="mongodb_data"
)
load_info = pipeline.run(source_data)
```
This example iterates through MongoDB collections, applying the **json** [data type](schema#data-types) to a specified column, and then processes the data with `pipeline.run`.

## View and print the schema
To view and print the default schema in a clear YAML format, use the command:

```py
pipeline.default_schema.to_pretty_yaml()
```
This can be used in a pipeline as:

```py
# Create a pipeline
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
               pipeline_name="chess_pipeline",
               destination='duckdb',
               dataset_name="games_data")

# Run the pipeline
load_info = pipeline.run(source)

# Print the default schema in a pretty YAML format
print(pipeline.default_schema.to_pretty_yaml())
```
This will display a structured YAML representation of your schema, showing details like tables, columns, data types, and metadata, including version, version_hash, and engine_version.

## Export and import schema files

Please follow the guide on [how to adjust a schema](../walkthroughs/adjust-a-schema.md) to export and import `yaml`
schema files in your pipeline.

## Attaching schemas to sources

We recommend not creating schemas explicitly. Instead, users should provide a few global schema
settings and then let the table and column schemas be generated from the resource hints and the
data itself.

The `dlt.source` decorator accepts a schema instance that you can create yourself and modify in
whatever way you wish. The decorator also supports a few typical use cases:

### Schema created implicitly by decorator

If no schema instance is passed, the decorator creates a schema with the name set to the source name and
all the settings to default.

### Automatically load schema file stored with source python module

If no schema instance is passed, and a file with a name `{source name}_schema.yml` exists in the
same folder as the module with the decorated function, it will be automatically loaded and used as
the schema.

This should make it easier to bundle a fully specified (or pre-configured) schema with a source.

### Schema is modified in the source function body

What if you can configure your schema or add some tables only inside your schema function, when, for example,
you have the source credentials and user settings available? You could, for example, add detailed
schemas of all the database tables when someone requests table data to be loaded. This information
is available only at the moment the source function is called.

Similarly to the `source_state()` and `resource_state()`, the source and resource function has the current
schema available via `dlt.current.source_schema()`.

Example:

```py
@dlt.source
def textual(nesting_level: int):
    # get the source schema from the `current` context
    schema = dlt.current.source_schema()
    # remove date detector
    schema.remove_type_detection("iso_timestamp")
    # convert UNIX timestamp (float, within a year from NOW) into timestamp
    schema.add_type_detection("timestamp")

    return dlt.resource([])
```
