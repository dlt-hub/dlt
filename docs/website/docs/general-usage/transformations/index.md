`dlt transformations` let you build new tables or full datasets from datasets that have _already_ been ingested with `dlt`. `dlt transformations` are written and run in a very similar fashion to dlt source and resources. `dlt transformations` require you to have loaded data to a location, for example a local duckdb database, a bucket or a warehouse on which the transformations may be executed. `dlt transformations` are fully supported for all of our sql destinations including all filesystem and bucket formats.

You create them with the `@dlt.transformation` decorator which has the same signature as the `@dlt.resource` decorator, but does not yield items but rather a SQL query including the resulting
column schema. dlt transformations support the same write_dispositions per destination as dlt resources do.

## Motivations

A few real-world scenarios where dlt transformations can be useful:

- **Build one-stop reporting tables** â€“ Flatten and enrich raw data into a wide table that analysts can pivot, slice, and dice without writing SQL each time.  
- **Clean data** â€“ Remove irrelevant columns or anonymize sensitive information before sending it to a layer with lower privacy protections.
- **Normalize JSON into 3-NF** â€“ Break out repeating attributes from nested JSON so updates are consistent and storage isn't wasted.  
- **Create dimensional (star-schema) models** â€“ Produce fact and dimension tables so BI users can drag-and-drop metrics and break them down by any dimension.  
- **Generate task-specific feature sets** â€“ Deliver slim tables tailored for personalization, forecasting, or other ML workflows.  
- **Apply shared business definitions** â€“ Encode rules such as "a *sale* is a transaction whose status became *paid* this month," ensuring every metric is counted the same way.  
- **Merge heterogeneous sources** â€“ Combine Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce (etc.) into one canonical *orders* feed for unified inventory and revenue reporting.  
- **Run transformations during ingestion pre-warehouse** â€“ Pre-aggregate or pre-filter data before it hits the warehouse to cut compute and storage costs.  
- **â€¦and more** â€“ Any scenario where reshaping, enriching, or aggregating existing data unlocks faster insight or cleaner downstream pipelines.


## Quick-start in three simple steps

For the example below you can copyâ€“paste everything into one script and run it. It is useful to know how to use dlt [Datasets and Relations](../dataset-access/dataset.md), since these are heavily used in transformations.

### 1. Load some example data

The snippets below assume that we have a simple fruitshop dataset as produced by the dlt fruitshop template:

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::quick_start_example-->


### 1.1 Use the fruitshop template as a starting point

Alternatively, you can follow the code examples below by creating a new pipeline with the fruitshop template and running transformatth scenarios.ions on the resulting dataset:

```sh
dlt init fruitshop duckdb
```

### 2. Inspect the dataset

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::dataset_inspection-->

### 3. Write and run a transformation

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::basic_transformation-->


### 3.1 Alternatively use pure SQL for the transformation 

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::sql_queries_short-->

That's it â€” `copied_customers` is now a new table in **the same** DuckDB schema with the first 5 customers when ordered by name. `dlt` has detected that we are loading into the same dataset
and executed this transformation in SQL - no data was transferred to and from the machine executing this pipeline. Additionally, the new destination table `copied_customers` was automatically evolved
to the correct new schema, and you could also set a different write disposition and even merge data from a transformation.

## Defining a transformation

:::info
Most of the following examples will be using the ibis expressions of the `dlt.Dataset`. Read the detailed [dataset docs](../../general-usage/dataset-access/dataset) to learn how to use these.
:::

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::orders_per_user-->

* **Decorator arguments** mirror those accepted by `@dlt.resource`.
* The transformation function signature must contain at least one `dlt.Dataset` which is used inside the function to create the transformation SQL statements and calculate the resulting schema update.
* Yields a `Relation` created with ibis expressions or a select query which will be materialized into the destination table. If the first item yielded is a valid sql query or relation object, data will be interpreted as a transformation. In all other cases, the tranformation decorator will work like any other resource.

## Loading to other datasets


### Loading to another dataset on the same physical location

Below we load to the same DuckDB instance with a new pipeline that points to another `dataset`. dlt will be able to detect that both datasets live on the same destination and
will run the transformation as pure SQL.

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::loading_to_other_datasets-->

### Loading to another dataset on a different physical location

Below we load the data from our local DuckDB instance to a Postgres instance. dlt will use the query to extract the data as Parquet files and will do a regular dlt load, pushing the data to Postgres. Note that you can use the exact same transformation functions for both scenarios. This can be extremely useful when you want to avoid compute costs in warehouses by running transformations directly from a local duckdb instance or raw data in a bucket into the warehouse, as the compute will happen on the machine executing the pipeline that runs the transformations.

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::loading_to_other_datasets_other_engine-->


## Using transformations


### Grouping multiple transformations in a source

`dlt transformations` can be grouped like all other resources into sources and will be executed together. You can even mix regular resources and transformations in one pipeline load.

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::multiple_transformations-->

### Yielding multiple transformations from one transformation resource

`dlt transformations` may also yield more than one transformation instruction. If no further table name hints are supplied, the result will be a union of the yielded transformation instructions. dlt will take care of the necessary schema migrations, you will just need to ensure that no columns are marked as non-nullable that are missing from one of the transformation insturctions:

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::multiple_transformation_instructions-->

### Supplying additional hints

You may supply column and table hints the same way you do for regular resources. `dlt` will derive schema hints from your query, but in some cases you may need to change or amend hints, such as making columsn nullable for the example above or change the precision or type of a column to make it work with a given target destination (if different from the source)

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::supply_hints-->

### Writing your queries in SQL

If you prefer to write your queries in SQL, you can omit ibis expressions by simply creating a `Relation` from a query on your dataset:

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::sql_queries-->

The identifiers (table and column names) used in these raw SQL expressions must correspond to the identifiers as they are present in your dlt schema, NOT in your destination database schema. 

## Using pandas dataframes or arrow tables

You can also directly write transformations using pandas or arrow. Please note that your transformation resource will act like a regular resource in this case, you will not have column level hints forward but rather dlt will just see the dataframes or arrow tables you yield and process them like from any other resource. This may change in the future.

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::arrow_dataframe_operations-->


## Schema evolution and hints lineage

When executing transformations, dlt computes the resulting schema before the transformation is executed. This allows dlt to:

1. Migrate the destination schema accordingly, creating new columns or tables as needed
2. Fail early if there are schema mismatches that cannot be resolved
3. Preserve column-level hints from source to destination

### Schema evolution

For example, if your transformation joins two tables and creates new columns, dlt will automatically update the destination schema to accommodate these changes. If your transformation would result in incompatible schema changes (like changing a column's data type in a way that could lose data), dlt will fail before executing the transformation, protecting your data and saving execution and debug time. 

You can inspect the computed result schema during development by looking at the result of `compute_columns_schema` on your `Relation`:

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::computed_schema-->

### Column level hint forwarding

When creating or updating tables with transformation resources, dlt will also forward certain column hints to the new tables. In our fruitshop source, we have applied a custom hint named
`x-annotation-pii` set to True for the `name` column, which indicates that this column contains PII (personally identifiable information). We might want to know downstream of our transformation layer
which columns resulted from origin columns that contain private data:

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::column_level_lineage-->

Features and limitations:

* `dlt` will only forward certain types of hints to the resulting tables: custom hints starting with `x-annotation...` and type hints such as `nullable`, `data_type`, `precision`, `scale`, and `timezone`. Other hints, such as `primary_key` or `merge_keys`, will need to be set via the `columns` argument on the transformation decorator, since dlt does not know how the transformed tables will be used.
* `dlt` will not be able to forward hints for columns that are the result of combining two origin columns, for example by concatenating them or similar sql operations.

## Query Normalization

### `dlt` columns

When executing transformations, dlt will add internal dlt columns to your SQL queries depending on the configuration:

- `_dlt_load_id`, which tracks which load operation created or modified each row, is **added by default**. Even if present in your query, the `_dlt_load_id` column will be **replaced with a constant value** corresponding to the current load ID. To disable this behavior, set:
    ```toml
    [normalize.model_normalizer]
    add_dlt_load_id = false
    ```
    In this case, the column will not be added or replaced.

- `_dlt_id`, a unique identifier for each row, is **not added by default**. If your query already includes a `_dlt_id` column, it will be left unchanged. To enable automatic generation of this column when itâ€™s missing, set:
    ```toml
    [normalize.model_normalizer]
    add_dlt_id = true
    ```
    When enabled and the column is not in the query, dlt will generate a `_dlt_id`. Note that if the column is already present, it will **not** be replaced.

    The `_dlt_id` column is generated using the destination's UUID function, such as `generateUUIDv4()` in ClickHouse. For dialects without native UUID support:
     - In **Redshift**, `_dlt_id` is generated using an `MD5` hash of the load ID and row number.
     - In **SQLite**, `_dlt_id` is simulated using `lower(hex(randomblob(16)))`.

Additionally, column names are normalized according to the naming schema selected and the identifier capabilities of the destinations. This ensures compatibility and consistent naming conventions across different data sources and destination systems.

This allows dlt to maintain data lineage and enables features like incremental loading and merging, even when working with raw SQL queries.

:::info
The normalization described here, including automatic injection or replacement of dlt columns, applies only to SQL-based transformations. Python-based transformations, such as those using dataframes or arrow tables, follow the [regular normalization process](../../reference/explainers/how-dlt-works#normalize).
:::

### Query Processing

When you run your transformations, `dlt` takes care of several important steps to ensure your queries are executed smoothly and correctly on the input dataset. Hereâ€™s what happens behind the scenes:

1. Expands any `*` (star) selects to include all relevant columns.
2. Adds special dlt columns (see below for details).
3. Fully qualifies all identifiers by adding database and dataset prefixes, so tables are always referenced unambiguously during query execution.
4. Properly quotes and, if necessary, adjusts the case of your identifiers to match the destinationâ€™s requirements.
5. Handles differences in naming conventions by aliasing columns and tables as needed, so names always match those in the destination.
6. Reorders columns to match the expected order in the destination table.
7. Fills in default `NULL` values for any columns that exist in the destination table but are not selected in your query.

Given a table of the name `my_table` with the columns `id` and `value` on `duckdb`, on a dataset with the name `my_dataset`, loaded into a dataset named `transformed_dataset`, the following query:

```sql
SELECT id, value FROM table
```

Will be translated to

```sql
INSERT INTO 
    "my_pipeline_dataset"."my_transformation" ("id", "value", "_dlt_load_id", "_dlt_id") 
SELECT 
    _dlt_subquery."id" AS "id", 
    _dlt_subquery."value" AS "value", 
    '1749134128.17655' AS "_dlt_load_id", 
    UUID() AS "_dlt_id" 
FROM (
    SELECT 
        "my_table"."id" AS "id", 
        "my_table"."value" AS "value" 
    FROM "my_pipeline_dataset"."my_table" AS "my_table"
    ) 
AS _dlt_subquery
```

## Examples

### Local in-transit transformations example

If you require aggregated or otherwise transformed data in your warehouse, but would like to avoid or reduce the costs of running queries across many rows in your warehouse tables, you can run some or all of your transformations "in transit" while loading data from your source. The code below demonstrates how you can extract data with our `rest_api` source to a local DuckDB instance and then forward aggregated data to a warehouse destination.

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::in_transit_transformations-->

This script demonstrates:
- Fetching data from a REST API using dlt's rest_api_source
- Loading raw data into a local DuckDB instance as an intermediate step
- Transforming the data by joining orders with stores and aggregating order counts directly on the local DuckDB instance, not in the destination warehouse
- Loading only the aggregated results to a production warehouse (Postgres)
- Reducing warehouse compute costs by performing transformations locally in DuckDB
- Using multiple pipelines in a single workflow for different stages of processing

### Incremental transformations example

:::info
This example demonstrates how to perform incremental transformations using an incremental primary key from the original tables. We're actively working to make incremental transformations based on `_dlt_load_id`s even easier in the near future.
:::

<!--@@@DLT_SNIPPET ./transformation-snippets.py::incremental_transformations-->

This example demonstrates how you can incrementally transform incoming new data for the customers table into a cleaned_customers table where the name column has been removed. It:
 * Uses primary key-based incremental loading to process only new data
 * Tracks the highest ID processed so far to filter out already processed records
 * Handles first-time runs with the PipelineNeverRan exception
 * Removes sensitive data (name column) during the transformation
 * Uses write_disposition="append" to add only new records to the destination table
 * Can be run repeatedly as new data arrives, processing only the delta
