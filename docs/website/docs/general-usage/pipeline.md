# Pipeline

A [pipeline](glossary.md#pipeline) is a connection that moves the data from your Python code to a
[destination](glossary.md#destination). Typically, you pass the `dlt` [sources](source.md) or
[resources](resource.md) to the pipeline. You can also pass generators, lists and other iterables to
it. When the pipeline runs, the resources get executed and the data is loaded at destination.

Example:

This pipeline will load a list of objects into `duckdb` table with a name "three":

```python
import dlt

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(destination="duckdb", dataset_name="sequence")

info = pipeline.run([{'id':1}, {'id':2}, {'id':3}], table_name="three")

print(info)
```

You instantiate a pipeline by calling `dlt.pipeline` function with following arguments:

- `pipeline_name` a name of the pipeline that will be used to identify it in trace and monitoring
  events and to restore its state and data schemas on subsequent runs. If not provided, `dlt` will
  create pipeline name from the file name of currently executing Python module.
- `destination` a name of the [destination](../dlt-ecosystem/destinations) to which dlt
  will load the data. May also be provided to `run` method of the `pipeline`.
- `dataset_name` a name of the dataset to which the data will be loaded. A dataset is a logical
  group of tables i.e. `schema` in relational databases or folder grouping many files. May also be
  provided later to the `run` or `load` methods of the pipeline. If not provided at all then
  defaults to the `pipeline_name`.

To load the data you call the `run` method and pass your data in `data` argument.

Arguments:

- `data` (the first argument) may be a dlt source, resource, generator function, or any Iterator /
  Iterable (i.e. a list or the result of `map` function).
- `write_disposition` controls how to write data to a table. Defaults to "append".
  - `append` will always add new data at the end of the table.
  - `replace` will replace existing data with new data.
  - `skip` will prevent data from loading.
  - `merge` will deduplicate and merge data based on `primary_key` and `merge_key` hints.
- `table_name` - specified in case when table name cannot be inferred i.e. from the resources or name
  of the generator function.

Example: This pipeline will load the data the generator `generate_rows(10)` produces:

```python
import dlt

def generate_rows(nr):
    for i in range(nr):
        yield {'id':1}

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(destination='bigquery', dataset_name='sql_database_data')

info = pipeline.run(generate_rows(10))

print(info)
```

## Pipeline working directory

Each pipeline that you create with `dlt` stores extracted files, load packages, inferred schemas,
execution traces and the [pipeline state](state.md) in a folder in the local filesystem. The default
location for such folders is in user home directory: `~/.dlt/pipelines/<pipeline_name>`.

You can inspect stored artifacts using the command
[dlt pipeline info](../reference/command-line-interface.md#dlt-pipeline) and
[programmatically](../walkthroughs/run-a-pipeline.md#4-inspect-a-load-process).

> ðŸ’¡ A pipeline with given name looks for its working directory in location above - so if you have two
> pipeline scripts that create a pipeline with the same name, they will see the same working folder
> and share all the possible state. You may override the default location using `pipelines_dir`
> argument when creating the pipeline.

> ðŸ’¡ You can attach `Pipeline` instance to an existing working folder, without creating a new
> pipeline with `dlt.attach`.

## Do experiments with full refresh

If you [create a new pipeline script](../walkthroughs/create-a-pipeline.md) you will be
experimenting a lot. If you want that each time the pipeline resets its state and loads data to a
new dataset, set the `full_refresh` argument of the `dlt.pipeline` method to True. Each time the
pipeline is created, `dlt` adds datetime-based suffix to the dataset name.

## Display the loading progress

You can add a progress monitor to the pipeline. Typically, its role is to visually assure user that
pipeline run is progressing. `dlt` supports 4 progress monitors out of the box:

- [enlighten](https://github.com/Rockhopper-Technologies/enlighten) - a status bar with progress
  bars that also allows for logging.
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) - most popular Python progress bar lib, proven to work in
  Notebooks.
- [alive_progress](https://github.com/rsalmei/alive-progress) - with the most fancy animations.
- **log** - dumps the progress information to log, console or text stream. **the most useful on
  production** optionally adds memory and cpu usage stats.

> ðŸ’¡ You must install the required progress bar library yourself.

You pass the progress monitor in `progress` argument of the pipeline. You can use a name from the
list above as in the following example:

```python
# create a pipeline loading chess data that dumps
# progress to stdout each 10 seconds (the default)
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="chess_pipeline",
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name="chess_players_games_data",
    progress="log"
)
```

You can fully configure the progress monitor. See two examples below:

```python
# log each minute to Airflow task logger
ti = get_current_context()["ti"]
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="chess_pipeline",
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name="chess_players_games_data",
    progress=dlt.progress.log(60, ti.log)
)
```

```python
# set tqdm bar color to yellow
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="chess_pipeline",
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name="chess_players_games_data",
    progress=dlt.progress.tqdm(colour="yellow")
)
```

Note that the value of the `progress` argument is
[configurable](../walkthroughs/run-a-pipeline.md#2-see-the-progress-during-loading).
