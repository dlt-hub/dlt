# Destination tables

When you run a [pipeline](pipeline.md), dlt creates tables in the destination database and loads the data
from your [source](source.md) into these tables. In this section, we will take a closer look at what
destination tables look like and how they are organized.

We start with a simple dlt pipeline:

```py
import dlt

data = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob'}
]

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name='quick_start',
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name='mydata'
)
load_info = pipeline.run(data, table_name="users")
```

:::note

Here we are using the [DuckDb destination](../dlt-ecosystem/destinations/duckdb.md), which is an in-memory database. Other database destinations
will behave similarly and have similar concepts.

:::

Running this pipeline will create a database schema in the destination database (DuckDB) along with a table named `users`. Quick tip: you can use the `show` command of the `dlt pipeline` CLI [to see the tables](../dlt-ecosystem/visualizations/exploring-the-data.md#exploring-the-data) in the destination database.

## Database schema

The database schema is a collection of tables that represent the data you loaded into the database.
The schema name is the same as the `dataset_name` you provided in the pipeline definition.
In the example above, we explicitly set the `dataset_name` to `mydata`. If you don't set it,
it will be set to the pipeline name with a suffix `_dataset`.

Be aware that the schema referred to in this section is distinct from the [dlt Schema](schema.md).
The database schema pertains to the structure and organization of data within the database, including table
definitions and relationships. On the other hand, the "dlt Schema" specifically refers to the format
and structure of normalized data within the dlt pipeline.

## Tables

Each [resource](resource.md) in your pipeline definition will be represented by a table in
the destination. In the example above, we have one resource, `users`, so we will have one table, `mydata.users`,
in the destination. Where `mydata` is the schema name, and `users` is the table name. Here also, we explicitly set
the `table_name` to `users`. When `table_name` is not set, the table name will be set to the resource name.

For example, we can rewrite the pipeline above as:

```py
@dlt.resource
def users():
    yield [
        {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'},
        {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob'}
    ]

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name='quick_start',
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name='mydata'
)
load_info = pipeline.run(users)
```

The result will be the same, but the table is implicitly named `users` based on the resource name.

:::note

Special tables are created to track the pipeline state. These tables are prefixed with `_dlt_`
and are not shown in the `show` command of the `dlt pipeline` CLI. However, you can see them when
connecting to the database directly.

:::

## Child and parent tables

Now let's look at a more complex example:

```py
import dlt

data = [
    {
        'id': 1,
        'name': 'Alice',
        'pets': [
            {'id': 1, 'name': 'Fluffy', 'type': 'cat'},
            {'id': 2, 'name': 'Spot', 'type': 'dog'}
        ]
    },
    {
        'id': 2,
        'name': 'Bob',
        'pets': [
            {'id': 3, 'name': 'Fido', 'type': 'dog'}
        ]
    }
]

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name='quick_start',
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name='mydata'
)
load_info = pipeline.run(data, table_name="users")
```

Running this pipeline will create two tables in the destination, `users` and `users__pets`. The
`users` table will contain the top level data, and the `users__pets` table will contain the child
data. Here is what the tables may look like:

**mydata.users**

| id | name | _dlt_id | _dlt_load_id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Alice | wX3f5vn801W16A | 1234562350.98417 |
| 2 | Bob | rX8ybgTeEmAmmA | 1234562350.98417 |

**mydata.users__pets**

| id | name | type | _dlt_id | _dlt_parent_id | _dlt_list_idx |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Fluffy | cat | w1n0PEDzuP3grw | wX3f5vn801W16A | 0 |
| 2 | Spot | dog | 9uxh36VU9lqKpw | wX3f5vn801W16A | 1 |
| 3 | Fido | dog | pe3FVtCWz8VuNA | rX8ybgTeEmAmmA | 0 |

When creating a database schema, dlt recursively unpacks nested structures into relational tables,
creating and linking children and parent tables.

This is how it works:

1. Each row in all (top level and child) data tables created by `dlt` contains UNIQUE column named
   `_dlt_id`.
1. Each child table contains FOREIGN KEY column `_dlt_parent_id` linking to a particular row
   (`_dlt_id`) of a parent table.
1. Rows in child tables come from the lists: `dlt` stores the position of each item in the list in
   `_dlt_list_idx`.
1. For tables that are loaded with the `merge` write disposition, we add a ROOT KEY column
   `_dlt_root_id`, which links child table to a row in top level table.


:::note

If you define your own primary key in a child table, it will be used to link to parent table
and the `_dlt_parent_id` and `_dlt_list_idx` will not be added. `_dlt_id` is always added even in
case the primary key or other unique columns are defined.

:::

## Naming convention: tables and columns

During a pipeline run, dlt [normalizes both table and column names](schema.md#naming-convention) to ensure compatibility with the destination database's accepted format. All names from your source data will be transformed into snake_case and will only include alphanumeric characters. Please be aware that the names in the destination database may differ somewhat from those in your original input.

## Load Packages and Load IDs

Each execution of the pipeline generates one or more load packages. A load package typically contains data retrieved from
all the [resources](glossary.md#resource) of a particular [source](glossary.md#source).
These packages are uniquely identified by a `load_id`. The `load_id` of a particular package is added to the top data tables
(referenced as `_dlt_load_id` column in the example above) and to the special `_dlt_loads` table with a status 0
(when the load process is fully completed).

To illustrate this, let's load more data into the same destination:

```py
data = [
    {
        'id': 3,
        'name': 'Charlie',
        'pets': []
    },
]
```

The rest of the pipeline definition remains the same. Running this pipeline will create a new load
package with a new `load_id` and add the data to the existing tables. The `users` table will now
look like this:

**mydata.users**

| id | name | _dlt_id | _dlt_load_id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Alice | wX3f5vn801W16A | 1234562350.98417 |
| 2 | Bob | rX8ybgTeEmAmmA | 1234562350.98417 |
| 3 | Charlie | h8lehZEvT3fASQ | **1234563456.12345** |

The `_dlt_loads` table will look like this:

**mydata._dlt_loads**

| load_id | schema_name | status | inserted_at | schema_version_hash |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1234562350.98417 | quick_start | 0 | 2023-09-12 16:45:51.17865+00 | aOEb...Qekd/58= |
| **1234563456.12345** | quick_start | 0 | 2023-09-12 16:46:03.10662+00 | aOEb...Qekd/58= |

The `_dlt_loads` table tracks complete loads and allows chaining transformations on top of them.
Many destinations do not support distributed and long-running transactions (e.g. Amazon Redshift).
In that case, the user may see the partially loaded data. It is possible to filter such data out: any
row with a `load_id` that does not exist in `_dlt_loads` is not yet completed. The same procedure may be used to identify
and delete data for packages that never got completed.

For each load, you can test and [alert](../running-in-production/alerting.md) on anomalies (e.g.
no data, too much loaded to a table). There are also some useful load stats in the `Load info` tab
of the [Streamlit app](../dlt-ecosystem/visualizations/exploring-the-data.md#exploring-the-data)
mentioned above.

You can add [transformations](../dlt-ecosystem/transformations/) and chain them together
using the `status` column. You start the transformation for all the data with a particular
`load_id` with a status of 0 and then update it to 1. The next transformation starts with the status
of 1 and is then updated to 2. This can be repeated for every additional transformation.

### Data lineage

Data lineage can be super relevant for architectures like the
[data vault architecture](https://www.data-vault.co.uk/what-is-data-vault/) or when troubleshooting.
The data vault architecture is a data warehouse that large organizations use when representing the
same process across multiple systems, which adds data lineage requirements. Using the pipeline name
and `load_id` provided out of the box by `dlt`, you are able to identify the source and time of
data.

You can [save](../running-in-production/running.md#inspect-and-save-the-load-info-and-trace)
complete lineage info for a particular `load_id` including a list of loaded files, error messages
(if any), elapsed times, schema changes. This can be helpful, for example, when troubleshooting
problems.

## Staging dataset

So far we've been using the `append` write disposition in our example pipeline. This means that
each time we run the pipeline, the data is appended to the existing tables. When you use [the
merge write disposition](incremental-loading.md), dlt creates a staging database schema for
staging data. This schema is named `<dataset_name>_staging` and contains the same tables as the
destination schema. When you run the pipeline, the data from the staging tables is loaded into the
destination tables in a single atomic transaction.

Let's illustrate this with an example. We change our pipeline to use the `merge` write disposition:

```py
import dlt

@dlt.resource(primary_key="id", write_disposition="merge")
def users():
    yield [
        {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice 2'},
        {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob 2'}
    ]

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name='quick_start',
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name='mydata'
)

load_info = pipeline.run(users)
```

Running this pipeline will create a schema in the destination database with the name `mydata_staging`.
If you inspect the tables in this schema, you will find `mydata_staging.users` table identical to the
`mydata.users` table in the previous example.

Here is what the tables may look like after running the pipeline:

**mydata_staging.users**

| id | name | _dlt_id | _dlt_load_id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Alice 2 | wX3f5vn801W16A | 2345672350.98417 |
| 2 | Bob 2 | rX8ybgTeEmAmmA | 2345672350.98417 |

**mydata.users**

| id | name | _dlt_id | _dlt_load_id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Alice 2 | wX3f5vn801W16A | 2345672350.98417 |
| 2 | Bob 2 | rX8ybgTeEmAmmA | 2345672350.98417 |
| 3 | Charlie | h8lehZEvT3fASQ | 1234563456.12345 |

Notice that the `mydata.users` table now contains the data from both the previous pipeline run and
the current one.

## Versioned datasets

When you set the `full_refresh` argument to `True` in `dlt.pipeline` call, dlt creates a versioned dataset.
This means that each time you run the pipeline, the data is loaded into a new dataset (a new database schema).
The dataset name is the same as the `dataset_name` you provided in the pipeline definition with a
datetime-based suffix.

We modify our pipeline to use the `full_refresh` option to see how this works:

```py
import dlt

data = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob'}
]

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name='quick_start',
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name='mydata',
    full_refresh=True # <-- add this line
)
load_info = pipeline.run(data, table_name="users")
```

Every time you run this pipeline, a new schema will be created in the destination database with a
datetime-based suffix. The data will be loaded into tables in this schema.
For example, the first time you run the pipeline, the schema will be named
`mydata_20230912064403`, the second time it will be named `mydata_20230912064407`, and so on.
