    Write disposition in the context of the dlt library defines how the data should be written to the destination. There are three types of write dispositions:

    * **Append**: This is the **default** disposition. It will append the data to the existing data in the destination.

    * **Replace**: This disposition replaces the data in the destination with the data from the resource. It **deletes** all the data and **recreates** the schema before loading the data.

    * **Merge**: This write disposition merges the data from the resource with the data at the destination. For the merge disposition, you need to specify a `primary_key` for the resource.

    The write disposition you choose depends on the dataset and how you can extract it. For more details, you can refer to the [Incremental loading page](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/incremental-loading).



    A `write_disposition` in `dlt` can specified in the resource decorator:

    ```python
    @dlt.resource(write_disposition="append")
    def my_resource():
      ...
      yield data
    ```

    Or directly in the pipeline run:

    ```python
    load_info = pipeline.run(my_resource, write_disposition="replace")
    ```

    > In case you specify both, the write disposition specified at the pipeline run level will override the write disposition specified at the resource level.

    ### **Replace**

    The `replace` strategy in the dlt library is used for **full loading** of data. This strategy completely overwrites the existing data with the new dataset. It's useful when you want to refresh the entire table with the latest data. It's important to note that this strategy technically does not load only new data but instead reloads all data: old and new.

    **Example: E-commerce Product Catalog refresh**

    - A large retailer (e.g., Amazon) needs to refresh their product catalog daily.

    - Using a replace strategy ensures all product details are up-to-date and no longer available products are removed.

    - Critical for ensuring customers see only valid products and prices.

    **Importance**: Guarantees consistency and accuracy in fast-changing datasets where full refreshes are simpler than merging updates.

    **Risks**: Data downtime if the refresh fails or takes too long.

    In dlt, you can control how the data is loaded into the destination table by setting the `write_disposition` parameter in the resource configuration. When you set the `write_disposition` to `replace`, it replaces the data in the destination table with the new data.

    For more details, you can refer to the following documentation pages:

    - [Full loading](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/full-loading)
    - [Write dispositions](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/incremental-loading#the-3-write-dispositions)

    ### **Merge**

    Consider a scenario where the data in the source has been updated, but you want to avoid reloading the entire dataset.

    **Example: Customer data integration (e.g., Salesforce CRM)**

    - A business integrates Salesforce CRM data with its data warehouse.

    - Sales representatives continuously update customer profiles. A merge strategy ensures that only the changed records are updated without affecting the entire dataset.

    - Useful for integrating various CRM systems where incremental updates are preferred over full reloads.

    Merge write disposition is used to merge new data into the destination, using a `merge_key` and/or **deduplicating**/**upserting** new data using a `primary_key`.

def _(mo):

    The **merge** write disposition can be useful in several situations:

    1.  If you have a dataset where records are frequently updated and you want to reflect these changes in your database, the merge write disposition can be used. It will **update the existing records** with the new data instead of creating duplicate entries.

    2. If your data source occasionally sends **duplicate records**, the merge write disposition can help handle this. It uses a `primary_key` to identify unique records, so if a duplicate record (with the same `primary_key`) is encountered, it will be merged with the existing record instead of creating a new one.

    3. If you are dealing with **Slowly Changing Dimensions** (SCD) where the attribute of a record changes over time and you want to maintain a history of these changes, you can use the merge write disposition with the scd2 strategy.


    When using the merge disposition, you need to specify a `primary_key` or `merge_key` for the resource.

    In this lesson, we will explore the concept of **full loading**, where we completely reload the data of our tables, removing all existing data and replacing it with new data from our source.


    We will also delve into the different replace strategies that dlt implements for doing a full load on your table:
    - `truncate-and-insert`,
    - `insert-from-staging`,
    - `staging-optimized`.

    ### **I. Truncate-and-Insert Strategy**

    **Overview**

    The `truncate-and-insert` strategy is the **default** replace strategy in dlt and is the **fastest** of all three strategies. This strategy is particularly useful when you want to completely refresh your data and you don't need to maintain the existing data in your tables during the load process.

    When you load data with the `truncate-and-insert` strategy, the destination tables will be truncated at the beginning of the load. This means that all existing data in the tables will be removed. After truncating the tables, the new data will be inserted. The insertion of new data happens consecutively but not within the same transaction.

    **Example: Daily ETL job for financial reports (e.g., Bloomberg Terminal Data)**

    - Daily financial summaries are generated and processed overnight.

    - Using `truncate-and-insert`, the pipeline ensures that analysts work with the most recent data every morning.

    **Configuration**

    You can select the `truncate-and-insert` strategy with a setting in your `config.toml` file.

    ```yaml
    [destination]
    replace_strategy = "truncate-and-insert"
    ```

    **Limitations**

    However, it's important to note that the **downside** of this strategy is that your **tables will have no data for a while** until the load is completed. You may end up with new data in some tables and no data in other tables if the load fails during the run. Such an incomplete load may be detected by checking if the `_dlt_loads` table contains a load id from `_dlt_load_id` of the replaced tables. If you prefer to have no data downtime, please use one of the other strategies.


    Here's an example of how to use the `truncate-and-insert` strategy with the Pokemon data:

    ### **II. Insert-from-staging Strategy**

    **Overview**

    The `insert-from-staging` strategy is used when you want to maintain a consistent state between nested and root tables at all times, with zero downtime. This strategy loads all new data into staging tables away from your final destination tables and then truncates and inserts the new data in one transaction.

    **Example: Airline reservation systems (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre)**

    - Ensuring that updated flight availability information doesn't interrupt user queries during ingestion.

    - Data is first written to staging tables and only swapped to production tables when the operation is complete.

    **Configuration**

    You can select the `insert-from-staging` strategy with a setting in your `config.toml` file. If you do not select a strategy, dlt will default to `truncate-and-insert`.

    ```yaml
    [destination]
    replace_strategy = "insert-from-staging"
    ```

    **Limitations**

    The `insert-from-staging` strategy, while ensuring zero downtime and maintaining a consistent state between nested and root tables, is **the slowest** of all three strategies. It loads all new data into staging tables away from your final destination tables and then truncates and inserts the new data in one transaction. This process can be time-consuming, especially for large datasets.

    Here's an example of how you can use this strategy:

    ### **III. Staging-optimized Strategy**


    The `staging-optimized` replace strategy is one of the three strategies implemented by dlt for doing a full load on your table.

    **Overview**

    The `staging-optimized` strategy **combines the benefits** of the `insert-from-staging` strategy with certain optimizations for **faster** loading on some destinations. However, it comes with a **trade-off**: destination tables may be dropped and recreated in some cases. This means that any views or other constraints you have placed on those tables will be dropped with the table.

    If you have a setup where you need to retain your destination tables, you should not use the `staging-optimized` strategy. On the other hand, if you do not care about tables being dropped but need the benefits of the `insert-from-staging` with some performance (and cost) saving opportunities, this strategy is a good choice.

    **Example: Data warehousing for Business Intelligence (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery)**

    - When refreshing tables with daily marketing analytics, staging-optimized strategy uses clone operations.

    - Clone operations in platforms like Snowflake are fast and cost-effective since they avoid data copying.

    **How it works**

    The `staging-optimized` strategy behaves differently across destinations:

    - **Postgres**: After loading the new data into the staging tables, the destination tables will be dropped and replaced by the staging tables. No data needs to be moved, so this strategy is almost as fast as `truncate-and-insert`.

    - **BigQuery**: After loading the new data into the staging tables, the destination tables will be dropped and recreated with a clone command from the staging tables. This is a low-cost and fast way to create a second independent table from the data of another. You can learn more about table cloning on BigQuery [here](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/bigquery).

    - **Snowflake**: After loading the new data into the staging tables, the destination tables will be dropped and recreated with a clone command from the staging tables. This is a low-cost and fast way to create a second independent table from the data of another. You can learn more about table cloning on Snowflake [here](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/snowflake).

    - For all **other destinations**, please look at their respective [documentation](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/) pages to see if and how the `staging-optimized` strategy is implemented. If it is not implemented, dlt will fall back to the `insert-from-staging` strategy.

    **Configuration**

    You can select the `staging-optimized` strategy with a setting in your `config.toml` file. If you do not select a strategy, dlt will default to `truncate-and-insert`.

    ```yaml
    [destination]
    # Set the optimized replace strategy
    replace_strategy = "staging-optimized"
    ```

    **Limitations**

    It's important to note that the `staging-optimized` replace strategy is **not implemented for all destinations**. For example, DuckDB doesn't support this strategy, that's why we skip the code example.

def _(mo):

    The `hard_delete` column hint can be used to delete records from the destination dataset. The behavior of the delete mechanism depends on the data type of the column marked with the hint:

    * `bool` type: only `True` leads to a delete, `None` and `False` values are disregarded.
    * Other types: each not `None` value leads to a delete.

    Each record in the destination table with the same `primary_key` or `merge_key` as a record in the source dataset that's marked as a delete will be deleted.

    Deletes are propagated to any nested table that might exist. For each record that gets deleted in the root table, all corresponding records in the nested table(s) will also be deleted.

    **Example: User account deletion (GDPR Compliance)**

    - An online social platform (e.g., Instagram, Facebook) allows users to permanently delete their accounts.

    - When a user requests account deletion, their data must be removed from the production dataset to comply with GDPR or CCPA requirements.

    - By marking records with a `deleted_flag = True`, the system ensures the user‚Äôs data is completely removed from the production tables during the next load operation.

    #### **Deduplication**

    By default, `primary_key` deduplication is arbitrary. You can pass the `dedup_sort` column hint with a value of `desc` or `asc` to influence which record remains after deduplication.

    - Using `desc`, the records sharing the same `primary_key` are sorted in **descending** order before deduplication, making sure the record with the highest value for the column with the `dedup_sort` hint remains.

    - `asc` has the opposite behavior.


    **Example: Email marketing platforms (e.g., Mailchimp, SendGrid)**

    - Users may accidentally submit the same email address multiple times during a signup process.

    - When ingesting these signups, using deduplication ensures that only unique email addresses are retained.

    - The `dedup_sort` hint allows prioritization of the latest record.

    ## **Missing incremental cursor path**

    You can customize the incremental processing of dlt by setting the parameter `on_cursor_value_missing`.

    When loading incrementally with the default settings, there are two assumptions:

    * Each row contains the cursor path.
    * Each row is expected to contain a value at the cursor path that is not `None`.

    **Example: IoT device data ingestion (e.g., Smart Homes)**

    - IoT devices (e.g., thermostats, cameras) send data continuously.

    - Due to network failures or device malfunctions, some records may lack timestamps or have None as their cursor value.

    - Using `on_cursor_value_missing="include"` ensures that such data is not discarded by default, allowing for later inspection and processing.

@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _(mo):

    To process a data set where some records **do not include the incremental cursor path** or where the values at the cursor path are **None**, there are the following four options:

    * Configure the incremental load to **raise** an exception in case there is a row where the cursor path is missing or has the value `None` using
      - `incremental(..., on_cursor_value_missing="raise")`.

      - This is the **default** behavior.
    * Configure the incremental load to **tolerate** the missing cursor path and `None` values using
      - `incremental(..., on_cursor_value_missing="include")`.
    * Configure the incremental load to **exclude** the missing cursor path and `None` values using
      - `incremental(..., on_cursor_value_missing="exclude")`.

    Here is an example of including rows where the **incremental cursor value** is **missing** or **None**:

    You can also define a [fall back column](https://dlthub.com/docs/devel/general-usage/incremental-loading#transform-records-before-incremental-processing) for an incremental cursor, as described below.

    ## **Transform records before incremental processing**

    If you want to load data that includes `None` values, you can transform the records before the incremental processing.
    You can add steps to the pipeline that [filter, transform, or pivot your data](https://dlthub.com/docs/devel/general-usage/resource#filter-transform-and-pivot-data).

    In the following example
    - the step of data yielding is at `index = 0`,
    - the custom transformation at `index = 1`,
    - and the incremental processing at `index = 2`.


    > **Caution!**
    >
    >It is important to set the `insert_at` parameter of the `add_map` function to control the order of execution and ensure that your custom steps are executed before the incremental processing starts.


    See below how you can modify rows before the incremental processing using `add_map()` and filter rows using `add_filter()`.
