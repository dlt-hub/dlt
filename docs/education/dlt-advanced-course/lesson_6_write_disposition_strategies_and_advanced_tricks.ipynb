    "The `truncate-and-insert` strategy is the **default** replace strategy in dlt and is the **fastest** of all three strategies. This strategy is particularly useful when you want to completely refresh your data and you don't need to maintain the existing data in your tables during the load process.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you load data with the `truncate-and-insert` strategy, the destination tables will be truncated at the beginning of the load. This means that all existing data in the tables will be removed. After truncating the tables, the new data will be inserted. The insertion of new data happens consecutively but not within the same transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Daily ETL job for financial reports (e.g., Bloomberg Terminal Data)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Daily financial summaries are generated and processed overnight.\n",

    "- Using `truncate-and-insert`, the pipeline ensures that analysts work with the most recent data every morning.\n",

    "replace_strategy = \"truncate-and-insert\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that the **downside** of this strategy is that your **tables will have no data for a while** until the load is completed. You may end up with new data in some tables and no data in other tables if the load fails during the run. Such an incomplete load may be detected by checking if the `_dlt_loads` table contains a load id from `_dlt_load_id` of the replaced tables. If you prefer to have no data downtime, please use one of the other strategies.\n",
