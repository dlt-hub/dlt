    ## **What is dlt?**

    In today's data-driven world, organizations often grapple with the challenge of efficiently **extracting, transforming,** and **loading** (ETL) data from various, often messy, data sources into well-structured, live datasets. This process can be complex, time-consuming, and prone to errors, especially when dealing with large volumes of data or nested data structures.

    Enter **dlt**, an **open-source Python library** designed to simplify and streamline this process. **dlt can load data from** a wide range of **sources** including REST APIs, SQL databases, cloud storage, and Python data structures, among others. It offers a lightweight interface that **infers schemas** and **data types**, **normalizes** the data, and handles **nested data** structures, making it easy to use, flexible, and scalable.

    Moreover, dlt supports a variety of **popular destinations** and allows for the addition of custom destinations to create **reverse ETL** pipelines. It can be deployed **anywhere Python runs**, be it on Airflow, serverless functions, or any other cloud deployment of your choice. With features like **schema evolution**, **data contracts** and **incremental loading**, dlt also automates pipeline maintenance, saving valuable time and resources.

    In essence, dlt is a powerful tool that simplifies the ETL process, making it more efficient and less error-prone. It allows data teams to **focus** on leveraging the data and driving value, while ensuring effective **governance** through timely notifications of any changes.

    A [pipeline](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/pipeline) is a connection that moves data from your Python code to a destination. The pipeline accepts dlt sources or resources, as well as generators, async generators, lists, and any iterables. Once the pipeline runs, all resources are evaluated and the data is loaded at the destination.

    You instantiate a pipeline by calling the `dlt.pipeline` function with the following arguments:
    * **`pipeline_name`**: This is the name you give to your pipeline. It helps you track and monitor your pipeline, and also helps to bring back its state and data structures for future runs. If you don't provide a name, dlt will use the name of the Python file you're running as the pipeline name.
    * **`destination`**: a name of the destination to which dlt will load the data. It may also be provided to the run method of the pipeline.
    * **`dataset_name`**: This is the name of the group of tables (or dataset) where your data will be sent. You can think of a dataset like a folder that holds many files, or a schema in a relational database. You can also specify this later when you run or load the pipeline. If you don't provide a name, it will default to the name of your pipeline.
    * **`dev_mode`**: If you set this to True, dlt will add a timestamp to your dataset name every time you create a pipeline. This means a new dataset will be created each time you create a pipeline.

    There are additional arguments for advanced use, but we’ll skip them for now.
