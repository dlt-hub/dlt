    "## **What is dlt?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's data-driven world, organizations often grapple with the challenge of efficiently **extracting, transforming,** and **loading** (ETL) data from various, often messy, data sources into well-structured, live datasets. This process can be complex, time-consuming, and prone to errors, especially when dealing with large volumes of data or nested data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter **dlt**, an **open-source Python library** designed to simplify and streamline this process. **dlt can load data from** a wide range of **sources** including REST APIs, SQL databases, cloud storage, and Python data structures, among others. It offers a lightweight interface that **infers schemas** and **data types**, **normalizes** the data, and handles **nested data** structures, making it easy to use, flexible, and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, dlt supports a variety of **popular destinations** and allows for the addition of custom destinations to create **reverse ETL** pipelines. It can be deployed **anywhere Python runs**, be it on Airflow, serverless functions, or any other cloud deployment of your choice. With features like **schema evolution**, **data contracts** and **incremental loading**, dlt also automates pipeline maintenance, saving valuable time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, dlt is a powerful tool that simplifies the ETL process, making it more efficient and less error-prone. It allows data teams to **focus** on leveraging the data and driving value, while ensuring effective **governance** through timely notifications of any changes.\n",
    "\n",
