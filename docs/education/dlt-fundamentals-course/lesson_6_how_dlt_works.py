        This is what happens when the `run` method is executed:

        1. **Extract** - Fully extracts the data from your source to your hard drive. In the example above, an implicit source with one resource with 3 items is created and extracted.
        2. **Normalize** - Inspects and normalizes your data and computes a schema compatible with your destination. For the example above, the normalizer will detect one column `id` of type `int` in one table named `items`, it will furthermore detect a nested list in table items and unnest it into a child table named `items__nested`.
        3. **Load** - Runs schema migrations if necessary on your destination and loads your data into the destination. For the example above, a new dataset on a local duckdb database is created that contains the two tables discovered in the previous steps.


        ## **Display the loading progress**
        Notice how we use `progress="log"` here.

        The `progress="log"` argument in the `dlt.pipeline` configuration enables detailed logging of the pipeline’s progress during execution. These logs provide visibility into the pipeline’s operations, showing how data flows through the **Extract**, **Normalize**, and **Load** phases. The logs include real-time metrics such as resource or file counts, time elapsed, processing rates, memory usage, and CPU utilization.


        dlt supports 4 progress monitors out of the box:

        * `enlighten` - a status bar with progress bars that also allows for logging.
        * `tqdm` - the most popular Python progress bar lib, proven to work in Notebooks.
        * `alive_progress` - with the most fancy animations.
        * `log` - dumps the progress information to log, console, or text stream. the most useful on production optionally adds memory and CPU usage stats.

        **Compression:** enabled by default.

        **Data type handling:**

        - `datetime` and `date` are stored as ISO strings;
        - `decimal` is stored as a text representation of a decimal number;
        - `binary` is stored as a base64 encoded string;
        - `HexBytes` is stored as a hex encoded string;
        - `complex` is serialized as a string.

        **By default used by:**

        - Bigquery
        - Snowflake
        - Filesystem

        **Configuration**:

        - Directly in the `pipeline.run()`:

          info = pipeline.run(some_source(), loader_file_format="jsonl")

@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _(mo):
    mo.md(r"""
        **Definition**: Apache Parquet is a free and open-source column-oriented data storage format in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.

        **Prerequisite:** To use this format, you need a pyarrow package. You can get this package as a dlt extra as well:

        ```py
        pip install "dlt[parquet]"

        ```

        **Default version**: 2.4, which coerces timestamps to microseconds and silently truncates nanoseconds for better compatibility with databases and pandas.

        **Supported by:**

        - Bigquery
        - DuckDB
        - Snowflake
        - Filesystem
        - Athena
        - Databricks
        - Synapse

        **Configuration**:

        - Directly in the `pipeline.run()`:

          ```py
          info = pipeline.run(some_source(), loader_file_format="parquet")
          ```

        - In `config.toml` or `secrets.toml`:

          ```py
          [normalize]
          loader_file_format="parquet"
          ```

        - Via environment variables:

          ```py
          export NORMALIZE__LOADER_FILE_FORMAT="parquet"
          ```

        - Specify directly in the resource decorator:

          ```py
          @dlt.resource(file_format="parquet")
          def generate_rows():
            ...
          ```


        **Destination AutoConfig**:

        `dlt` automatically configures the Parquet writer based on the destination's capabilities:

        - Selects the appropriate decimal type and sets the correct precision and scale for accurate numeric data storage, including handling very small units like Wei.

        - Adjusts the timestamp resolution (seconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds) to match what the destination supports


        **Writer settings:**

        `dlt` uses the pyarrow Parquet writer for file creation. You can adjust the writer's behavior with the following options:

        - `flavor` adjusts schema and compatibility settings for different target systems. Defaults to None (pyarrow default).
        - `version` selects Parquet logical types based on the Parquet format version. Defaults to "2.6".
        - `data_page_size` sets the target size for data pages within a column chunk (in bytes). Defaults to None.
        - `timestamp_timezone` specifies the timezone; defaults to UTC.
        - `coerce_timestamps` sets the timestamp resolution (s, ms, us, ns).
        - `allow_truncated_timestamps` raises an error if precision is lost on truncated timestamps.

          **Example configurations:**

          - In `configs.toml` or `secrets.toml`:
            ```py
            [normalize.data_writer]
            # the default values
            flavor="spark"
            version="2.4"
            data_page_size=1048576
            timestamp_timezone="Europe/Berlin"
            ```

          - Via environment variables:
            ```py
            export  NORMALIZE__DATA_WRITER__FLAVOR="spark"
            ```


        **Timestamps and timezones**

        `dlt` adds UTC adjustments to all timestamps, creating timezone-aware timestamp columns in destinations (except DuckDB).

        **Disable timezone/UTC adjustments:**

        - Set `flavor` to spark to use the deprecated `int96` timestamp type without logical adjustments.

        - Set `timestamp_timezone` to an empty string (`DATA_WRITER__TIMESTAMP_TIMEZONE=""`) to generate logical timestamps without UTC adjustment.

        By default, pyarrow converts timezone-aware DateTime objects to UTC and stores them in Parquet without timezone information.

          - complex (nested, struct) types are not supported
        2. `python stdlib writer` - a csv writer included in the Python standard library for Python objects

          - complex columns dumped with json.dumps
          - None values are always quoted

        **Default settings:**

        quoting style is "when needed"
