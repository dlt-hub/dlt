# # this is example of extracting from iterator that may be a
# # - jsonl file you read line by line
# # - a list of dicts
# # - iterator over panda frame https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_dict.html
# # - any iterator with map function
# # - any iterator whatsoever ie getting data from REST API

# # extracting from iterator always happens in single worker thread and iterator is directly returning data so there's no retry mechanism if anything fails
